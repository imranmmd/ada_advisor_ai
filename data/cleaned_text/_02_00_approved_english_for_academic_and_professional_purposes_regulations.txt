ENGLISH FOR ACADEMIC AND 
PROFESSIONAL PURPOSES REGULATIONS 

1. Purpose 
 
The language of instruction at ADA University is predominantly English. Since the University aims 
to ensure that all its students are able to study their respective degree programs, to fully participate 
in courses, and to successfully complete all the required learning activities and coursework, it offers 
an English language program to its undergraduate students. 
 
The purpose of this document is to delineate the minimum language requirements for undergraduate 
students and the regulations of the University’s English language program. 

2. Scope and Recommendations 
 
This document applies to all undergraduate degree programs offered at ADA University. 
 
Undergraduate students are expected to be thoroughly familiar with the requirements and regula-
tions set forth in this document. 

3. Definition 
 
The English for Academic and Professional Purposes (EAPP) Program is a non-credit program that 
serves to prepare undergraduate students for the study of their degree program at ADA University. 

4. English Language Requirements and Regulations 
 
4.1 General Provisions 
a. All students of ADA University must have a level of English proficiency that is sufficient to 
study their respective degree programs and to successfully complete all the required learn-
ing activities and coursework. 
b. ADA University conducts an English Proficiency Exam (EPE) three times per year (in Au-
gust, in December or early January, and in May). These exams serve as placement tests 
and also allow students to evaluate their overall progress in the EAPP Program. 
c. Newly admitted undergraduate students (incoming students) must either confirm their level 
of English in the EPE prior to the beginning of their studies, or they must present a valid 
English language proficiency test result upon admission, namely IELTS (6.0), TOEFL iBT 
(75), PTE (50), or Duolingo (105). 
d. Incoming students who score at least 60% in the EPE or who previously achieved a mini-
mum test score as indicated above in 4.1.c will directly enroll in their respective degree 
programs. 
 
4.2 English for Academic and Professional Purposes Program 
a. Incoming students who score less than 60% in the EPE or who previously achieved an Eng-
lish language proficiency test score below those indicated above in 4.1.c must enroll in and 
successfully complete the English for Academic and Professional Purposes (EAPP) Pro-
gram.

b. EAPP is a non-credit program and does thus not count towards the total of credits earned 
in a degree program. Grades from EAPP courses do not count towards a student’s TGPA 
and CGPA. 
c. Based on their EPE, TOEFL iBT, IELTS, PTE or Duolingo results, and unless they may 
directly enroll in their respective degree programs, incoming students are placed in one of 
the four levels and groups of the EAPP Program specified in the following table. Unless they 
fail and need to repeat a level, students remain in their respective groups until the completion 
of the EAPP Program.

d. The number of sessions and classes students need to attend in order to complete the EAPP 
Program depends on their level and group (with classes consisting of 2 contact hours each):

e. Each session consists of 3 different courses (Listening and Speaking, Reading and Writing, 
Language Use) and thus covers all 4 language skills. The number of classes per course 
depends on the EAPP level and the corresponding length of a session. It varies from 30 to 
52 in a 7.5-week session and from 45 to 94 in a 15-week session (further details are outlined 
in the EAPP program description). 
f. A level is considered to be successfully completed if a student achieves an overall grade of 
C (73%) or better. If an EAPP student receives an overall grade below C (73%) for a session 
or level, and except for level 1, he/she must repeat the entire level. Students may repeat 
one or more level(s) to complete the EAPP Program as long as they do not exceed the 
maximum duration for completion of the program (2 academic years). 
g. The exception to the minimum grade requirement outlined above in 4.2.f is level 1. EAPP 
students may proceed to level 2 even if their overall grade for level 1 was below C (73%). 
h. To complete the EAPP Program and enroll in a degree program, students must successfully 
complete the upper-intermediate level. All students are expected to complete the EAPP Pro-
gram and reach the upper-intermediate level within two academic years. 
i. Students who fail to complete the EAPP Program within the maximum duration of 2 aca-
demic years are dismissed from the University. Following their dismissal, and after one se-
mester or term, they may reapply for admission to ADA University by submitting one of the 
following minimum English language proficiency test results: IELTS (6.0), TOEFL iBT (75),

=== PAGE 12 ===
PTE (50), or Duolingo (105). A student who is readmitted is governed by the academic and 
financial requirements as well as by the Academic Catalogue in effect at the time of read-
mission. 
j. Only EAPP students who have successfully completed the EAPP level 4 may register for 
degree program courses. Students may alternatively take the English Proficiency Exam con-
ducted in December or early January, or in May. If they score at least 60% in the exam, they 
are eligible to register for degree program courses. 

5. Program Development and Implementation 
 
5.1 The development and modification of the EAPP Program and of its curriculum and courses is
