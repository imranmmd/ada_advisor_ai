1. ADA MISSION AND ACADEMIC QUALITY 

1. Mission Statement 
 
Our mission is to cultivate highly intellectual solution providers who are closely collaborating, efficiently 
communicating members of the global community, possessing ethics and a sense of citizenship. 

2. The Mission’s Pillars 
 
ADA University’s mission (together with its charter and vision) provides the foundation for the institution 
and its purposes in general as well as for its academic programs, principles and processes in particular. 
This mission rests on two pillars: 
1. It first of all aims to educate professionals who are highly competent and able to provide adequate 
solutions to the problems and challenges of an increasingly globalized world. This presupposes that 
graduates are not only well-trained in their respective fields of study, but that they also possess 
competencies that are indispensable in the 21st century, namely the ability to communicate and 
collaborate successfully with others, and this across disciplines, cultures and all (real or imagined) 
borders. 
2. Equally important, it aims to cultivate citizens who possess high ethical values, who feel responsible 
for the well-being of others and of the community as a whole, and who actively promote the public 
good. 

3. The Mission and Academic Quality 
 
ADA University’s mission and its two pillars presuppose an environment of academic excellence. 
Excellence is based on dedication, the willingness to strive for the highest standards of quality. Only 
such an environment will allow students to fully develop their intellectual potential and personal qualities. 
Only such an environment will enable the University to attract highly qualified and dedicated teachers, 
scholars and staff and to offer them the best opportunities for teaching, research and life-long learning. 
And only such an environment will allow ADA University to live up to its vision to be a world-class 
university in Azerbaijan.
