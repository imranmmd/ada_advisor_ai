Policy and Procedures

4121. Late Payment Fees 
1.1. All payments must be made before the due dates, including a disbursement of any loan 
proceeds by students’ bank. 
1.2. ADA University allows a Grace Period of 10 calendar days, past due dates, to 
accommodate unforeseen circumstances beyond student’s control in making the 
payments. Once the Grace Period is over, the University starts enforcing 
administrative holds. 
1.3. Students with outstanding balance not exceeding the sum of their tuition and student 
fees for one semester are allowed to take an academic leave. Those students can return 
from the academic leave only in the condition of covering their full outstanding 
balance. 
4122. Holds 
2.1. Holds are placed to students’ accounts with outstanding balances to prevent in-debt 
students from requesting an official transcript, verifying their enrollment, seeing 
grades, registering to the courses, accessing to Blackboard, graduating, and receiving 
a diploma. 
2.1.1. Students with outstanding balance less than 500 AZN will be prevented from 
requesting an official transcript, verifying their enrollment, graduating, and 
receiving a diploma. 
2.1.2. Students with outstanding balance more than 500 will be prevented from 
requesting any type of a transcript, verifying their enrollment, seeing grades, 
registering to the courses, accessing to Blackboard, graduating, and receiving 
a diploma.
