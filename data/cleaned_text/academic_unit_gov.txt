Policy and Procedures Academic Unit Governance

=== PAGE 2 ===
1. Faculty Council 
 
 Each academic unit must have at least one faculty council for governance. The faculty of each 
academic unit should construct this council to provide a voice for every faculty member in the 
unit. Academic unit faculty could also form additional committees. The faculty council and 
committees must act in conformity with policies and regulations established by the Senate. Faculty 
Council should meet at least once a month during the academic year period. 
 
2. Deans of Academic Units 
 
 The Rector appoints the deans of the Schools, in consultation with the Vice Rector of Academic 
Affairs (VRAA) and with the advice of the faculty of the academic unit concerned. Deans are the 
chief executive officers and academic leaders of their units. They provide opportunities for growth 
and development of their faculty, students and staff. The deans report to the VRAA and develop 
and make recommendations about all areas of their academic unit, including faculty hiring, 
reappointment and promotion. 
 
3. Program Director 
 
 The academic unit dean appoints the Program Director, in consultation with the faculty council 
of the academic unit. Should the dean make such an appointment, reasons for that appointment 
will be supplied to the faculty council. Program Directors are the academic leaders of their program 
and are responsible for the professional development of its constituents. They report to their deans, 
oversee the administrative functioning of their program, and make recommendations for faculty 
hiring, reappointment and promotion.
