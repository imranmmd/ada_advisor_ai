===== PAGE 14 =====
Page 14 
Excessive use and its negative consequences, especially in prohibited use cases is described in the 
examples below: 
 
Why the excessive use of university technology resources along with the unauthorized use cases 
should be avoided? 
 
Non-university authorized commercial purposes: 
 
Examples: 
An employee uses university computers to run a side business, leading to excessive bandwidth 
consumption and slowing down university network access for others. 
A student uses university servers to host a personal website that generates high traffic, affecting the 
performance of university systems. 
 
Political objectives: 
 
Examples: 
A staff member sends mass emails advocating for a political candidate using university email, 
resulting in excessive use of email resources and potentially violating university policies on political 
campaigning. 
A student uses university computers and printing/copying services to create and distribute political 
flyers, causing excessive load on the equipment and misuse of university printing resources. 
 
Other non-university related activities: 
 
Examples: 
An employee streams movies and TV shows during work hours, consuming excessive network 
bandwidth and impacting the speed of university internet for academic purposes. 
A student downloads large files for personal use, such as games or entertainment media, leading to 
slow network speeds for academic research and coursework for other students, causing ineffective 
and no-authorized use of university provided storage space. 
In these examples, the excessive use of university technology resources for personal, political, or 
non-university related activities can have negative consequences, such as compromising system 
security, violating acceptable use policies, and impacting the ability of others to use the resources for 
their intended academic or administrative purposes. 
 
There are certain ways to follow IT best practices, to report security breaches, to protect university 
devices, and to comply with policies and regulations, examples provided below: 
 
Following IT best practices and other applicable policies: 
 
Examples: 
An employee complies with the requests from IT&S department to regularly update their computer's 
operating system and software to protect against security vulnerabilities. 
 
A student uses strong, unique passwords for their university accounts to prevent unauthorized 
access and password guessing, does not use university credentials (email address and password) to 
register on Internet services and websites which are not related to learning process, especially for


===== PAGE 15 =====
Page 15 
personal non-university use (online shopping, multimedia streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and 
others, social networks, government services and other online and offline services used personally. 
However, a student can use university email to apply for summer internships, job search, graduate, 
and postgraduate program applications. 
 
Reporting security breaches or incidents: 
 
Examples: 
An employee notices unusual activity on their university email account and reports it to the IT&S 
department. 
A student receives a suspicious email asking for personal information and reports it to IT&S 
department. 
 
Protecting university-owned or operated devices: 
 
Examples: 
An employee/instructor keeps university provided equipment in a secure location while outside of 
the university premises to secure the university laptop when not in use to prevent theft or 
tampering. Locking the screen of the computer while away also prevents unauthorized access to 
view or tamper with confidential information such as grades, research etc. 
 
A student uses screen lock on personal computer to secure access to his university related data in a 
public space. 
 
A student refrains from tampering with the cabling or system setup of smartboards, understanding 
that these devices are fixed installations and require proper care to maintain functionality. A faculty 
member refrains from tampering with the cabling or location of the instructor’s desk considering 
that the desk setup is a fixed installation, and it is required to stay so to provide reliable, controllable, 
and expectable environment for all faculty members. 
 
Complying with applicable university policies and regulations: 
Examples: 
An employee reviews the university's “Personal Data Usage and Public Information” policy and 
ensures that they handle university data in accordance with it. 
 
A student reads the university's acceptable use policy for technology resources and follows the 
guidelines when using university computers, classroom equipment and networks. 
 
Conclusion 
 
All authorized users are responsible for knowing and adhering to the regulations and policies of the 
university that apply to their use of university technologies and resources. It is essential to exercise 
common sense and good judgment in the use of the university's technological, digital, and 
information resources.
