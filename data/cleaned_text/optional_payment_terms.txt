4111. Optional Payment Terms 
1.1. To assist students with payment of tuition fee only, ADA University offers optional 
payment terms for both returning undergraduate and returning graduate students. All 
other fees must be paid in full by the respective deadlines for each semester. 
1.2. Returning undergraduate and graduate students may request optional payment terms 
by submitting an application to the Finance Office by the deadlines set by the Finance 
Office each term. 
1.3. Upon the confirmation of the application for the optional payment terms by the 
Finance Office, returning students may pay their tuition fee as per the payment 
schedule assigned to them. 
1.4. Incoming undergraduate and graduate students may not request optional payment 
terms. They are required to pay the first semester of tuition and student fees before the 
start of the academic year. 
1.5. There are no grace periods applicable for the installment payments option, which 
means that deadlines must be strictly followed. In case of a violation of deadlines of 
the installment payments, an applicant’s plan is dismissed, administrative holds apply, 
and a further application by the applicant is restricted in the future.
