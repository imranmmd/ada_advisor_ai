FOREWORD 
Each member of the faculty of ADA University accepts a mutual set of obligations and 
expectations at the time of initial appointment. The ADA University Faculty Handbook presents 
these obligations and expectations as a guide to university policies and practices regarding 
faculty. The Handbook is not an exhaustive collection of policies affecting ADA University 
faculty and it is the responsibility of each faculty member to be familiar with the most current 
policies affecting their employment relationship with the University. 
The university does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, 
sex, gender, age, disability, marital status, personal appearance, sexual orientation, family 
responsibilities or political affiliation. Seeking a diverse faculty and administration, the 
university strives to conform to all applicable equal employment opportunity. 
With the principles set forth in the Handbook comes the firm intention of the university 
to provide as favorable working conditions for its faculty as resources permit and an atmosphere 
in which faculty members may pursue their scholarly, creative, and professional activities and 
interests, freely and without restraint. In return, the university expects faculty members to devote 
themselves with energy to the primary duties of teachers, scholars, and creators of knowledge 
and to challenge students intellectually and encourage them to acquire knowledge, 
understanding, and vision. 
This Handbook applies to all faculty at the university with the exceptions noted below or 
unless a specific rule, regulation, or policy requires otherwise. Any faculty member may submit 
to the Dean of an academic unit a recommendation to amend the Handbook, who, in return, 
submits it to the Vice Rector of Academic Affairs for consideration. If approved, the Vice Rector 
of Academic Affairs forwards the recommendation to the University Senate, which may either 
accept or reject the recommendation. If the recommendation is accepted, the University Senate 
forwards the recommendation to the Rector who may either accept or reject it. 
Handbook is a product of shared governance involving the participation of the faculty and 
academic leadership. Questions of interpretation regarding this Handbook should be directed to 
the Vice Rector of Academic Affairs. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
The ADA University Faculty Handbook contains University policies, procedures, and 
other information in effect as of the date of issuance. Any subsequent changes in policies, 
procedures, or other information are effective as of the date of action or issuance by the 
appropriate University body even though such changes have not been distributed as revisions or 
additions to the Handbook. Revisions of, or additions to, the Handbook will be issued regularly 
(usually annually) to Deans and program directors. In the interim, every effort will be made to 
communicate revisions and additions to Deans and program directors for communication to 
faculty and academic staff members.

Honor Code 
 
ADA University is a community of students, staff, faculty and administrators, united by 
the common goal of promoting excellence in education, research, and service. ADA University 
strives to provide state-of-the-art facilities and a supportive environment for its community 
members to engage in an inspiring and dynamic learning process. The University places a high 
value and emphasis on the academic success and achievements of its community members. 
However, this must be obtained in an environment guided by academic honesty, integrity, and 
with a commitment to personal and mutual accountability. The University’s philosophy is 
centered on the idea that academic integrity and honesty should be promoted not by use of 
sanctions and threats, but rather by instilling an academic culture grounded by these values. The 
Honor Code contains a list of academic rules and procedures essential to guide the conduct of 
students, staff, faculty, and administrators alike. The sanctions contained in this guide are 
intended only as a last resort, allowing ADA University to defend itself and its reputation against 
violations of these generally accepted standards of proper academic conduct. 
 
Principles of Academic Honesty and Integrity 
 
a. Do Not Lie! Purposefully providing false information by lying, falsifying, deceiving, or 
fraud is unacceptable behavior at ADA University. 
b. Do Not Cheat! Violating rules of examinations, tests and other assignments as well as 
accepting unauthorized help is not acceptable behavior at ADA University. 
c. Do Not Plagiarize! Using someone else's intellectual or physical work without giving 
proper credit to the author or submitting the same paper for two or more classes without 
receiving prior consent from the necessary authorities, is not acceptable behavior at ADA 
University. 
d. Do Not Discriminate! Discrimination based on race, gender, ethnicity, religious 
affiliation, sexual orientation, or disabilities is not acceptable behavior at ADA 
University. 
e. Do Not Help Others Violate These Principles! 
 
For more information on Honor Code, please see Appendix 1. 
 
Academic Freedom 
 
The University endorses full freedom for its faculty in teaching, scholarship, and creative 
activity. A fundamental premise in ADA University’s educational mission is academic freedom: 
the faculty has the responsibility to determine the curriculum, methods of delivery, and the 
assessment of student performance. The faculty fulfills this responsibility through individual 
faculty and committee efforts at the School and University levels. The faculty is entitled to 
freedom in the classroom when discussing their subjects. Meanwhile, faculty at the University 
are citizens, members of a learned profession, and officers of an educational institution. When 
they speak, or write as citizens, they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline, 
but their special position in the community imposes special obligations. As scholars and

ADA University

educational officers, they should remember that the public might judge their profession and their 
institution by their utterances. Hence, they should be accurate, exercise appropriate restraint, 
show respect for the opinions of others, and make every effort to indicate that they are not 
speaking for the institution. 

ORGANIZATION AND GOVERNANCE 
The university is committed to following procedures which promote shared governance 
that is transparent and accountable at every level of operation. Effective governance requires 
broad participation. Individual faculty can be their own best advocates through maintaining 
familiarity with this Handbook and by staying current with issues in faculty governance. 
The following bodies and individuals are integral to shared governance and are involved 
in reviewing faculty actions, policies, or procedures.

FACULTY 
 
Faculty Rights and Responsibilities 
As the primary functions of an academic community, learning, teaching, scholarship, and 
public service requires a fundamental commitment to academic freedom and maintained through 
reasoned discourse, intellectual honesty, mutual respect and openness to constructive criticism 
and change. Faculty members, as central to this community, serve as scholars pursuing the 
search for knowledge and its free expression, as teachers instructing students, and as 
professionals and citizens contributing special knowledge and skills through public service and 
community participation. In the performance of all these functions, faculty members are held 
accountable to the University, in accordance with established policies and procedure. In order to 
carry out the mission of the University faculty members, as members of both the academic and 
the broader public community, have the right to a clear statement of academic freedom and 
other fundamental faculty rights and responsibilities. The purpose of this document is to 
acknowledge these fundamental rights and responsibilities. 
 
a. Academic Freedom, Responsibility and Accountability 
 ADA University endorses academic freedom, responsibility, and accountability as 
essential to attainment of the University's goal of the unfettered search for knowledge and its free 
exposition. Academic freedom, responsibility and accountability are fundamental characteristics 
of the University environment and are always closely interwoven and at times indistinguishable. 
Academic freedom, responsibility and accountability are the guardians of the integrity and quality 
of universities. The University looks to its faculty members to exercise their rights responsibly 
and to meet their obligations fully as professionals. Faculty acceptance of their responsibilities to 
students, colleagues, the scholarly community, and the public explains in great part why society 
historically has accepted the concept of academic freedom and has afforded its protection through 
the institution of academic tenure. 
For faculty members, the principal elements of academic freedom include: 
• The right, as teachers, to discuss in the classroom any material which has a significant 
relationship to the subject matter as defined in the approved course description; 
• The right to determine course content, grading, and classroom procedures in the courses 
they teach; 
• The right to conduct research and to engage in creative endeavors; 
• The right to publish or present research and scholarship findings and creative works; 
• The right to engage in public service activities; 
• The right to seek changes in institutional policy through established University procedures 
and by lawful and peaceful means.

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 12 ===
Academic freedom carries with it responsibilities. For faculty members, the principal elements 
include: 
 
1. The responsibility to carry out assigned teaching, scholarship, and public service duties 
in a professional manner and in keeping with University policy; 
2. The responsibility, as teachers, to refrain from introducing matters which are not 
consistent with their teaching duties and professional competence and which have no 
significant bearing on the subject matter of the course as approved under University 
procedures; 
3. The responsibility to pursue excellence and intellectual honesty in teaching, scholarship, 
and other creative endeavors and in public service activities; and in publishing or 
presenting scholarship findings and creative works; 
4. The responsibility to encourage students and colleagues to engage in free discussion and 
inquiry; and to evaluate student and colleague performance on a scholarly basis; 
5. The responsibility to work in a collegial manner with appropriate individuals and bodies 
to encourage the free search for knowledge; its free exposition, and the University's 
continuing quest for excellence; 
6. The responsibility to carefully differentiate their official activities as faculty members 
from their personal activities as citizens and, when the situation warrants, to make it 
clear that, when speaking as private citizens, they do not speak for the University 
The above list provides a summary outline of the principal elements of academic freedom, 
responsibility, and accountability. The faculty have a right to expect that the University's core 
faculty system is characterized by high integrity and have a responsibility to participate in the 
operation of the core faculty seriously and in good faith. All decisions involving core faculty 
system recommendations shall be made in conformity to the University-approved policies and 
procedures that govern the core faculty system. 
 
a. Academic Governance 
The faculty have a right and responsibility to participate in the establishment and 
functioning of a governance system at the school and University levels to ensure academic 
freedom and the promotion of the goals of the institution. 
The University looks to the faculty for recommendations on various academic personnel 
matters including faculty hiring, reappointments, promotions, the award of core faculty 
guidelines; on the development of new academic programs and the modifications or 
discontinuance of existing programs, on academic curricula and standards; on policies governing 
scholarship and creative endeavors; on the formulation of annual budget requests and allocations; 
and on the selection and review of specified administrative officials, as well as other issues that 
concern the general welfare of the University, including student affairs and the academic 
environment. 
Through the academic governance system, the University accords a central role to faculty 
peer review in the schools and the University. Faculty have a responsibility to participate in peer 
review procedures to ensure personnel recommendations which promote excellence. In accordance

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 13 ===
with established School and University policies, faculty members have the right to be informed of the 
standards, criteria, procedures, and other conditions which affect all aspects of their appointment in 
the core faculty system, to be evaluated in a fair, objective manner, and to receive timely notice 
regarding their future appointment status at ADA University. 
b. Teaching 
Because the faculty's role in the educational process is primary and central, the faculty 
member, as teacher, has the responsibility to make every effort to be accurate, objective, and 
effective. In the classroom, the teacher shall address topics and present materials consistent with the 
teaching assignments as defined in the approved course objectives. 
The teacher has the responsibility to encourage the pursuit of learning by students by 
manifesting the best academic standards of the discipline or profession. To accord students’ respect 
as individuals, the teacher shall seek to establish a relationship of mutual trust and to establish an 
appropriate role as an intellectual guide, counselor, and mentor, both in and out of the classroom. If 
problems arise in the relationship between teacher and student, whether on personal matters or on 
instructional materials or methods, both teacher and student shall attempt to resolve them in informal, 
direct discussions as between well-intentioned, reasonable persons. 
The teacher has the responsibility not to exploit students for private gains and advantage; the 
teacher also should avoid any form of discrimination or harassment, with the understanding that 
racism, sexism, and other forms of bias preclude the establishment of an effective learning 
environment. 
The teacher has the responsibility to foster and require honest academic conduct. The 
teacher has authority and responsibility for grades and shall assure that the evaluation and 
assessment of academic performance reflect each student's true achievement by good faith 
application of criteria appropriate to the field of study and the course. The teacher shall further 
protect academic freedom for faculty and students by acknowledging the contributions of 
students to professional work of faculty members and by assuring that each student is free to 
voice opinions openly and to exchange ideas freely. 
Teachers have the responsibility to observe the University and School policies 
regarding such matters as the statement of course objectives, examination policy, office 
hours, course evaluations, and other provisions. 
c. Scholarship and Creativity 
To fulfill the University's mission of advancing and disseminating knowledge for the 
improvement of the welfare of the public, faculty members have a responsibility to engage in 
appropriate scholarly and creative activity in their area(s) of appointment and professional 
competence. Recognition of professional competence and definition of area(s) of appointment 
occur in the basic academic units through procedures in which established systems of peer review 
play a central role. 
As scholars, faculty members have the right and responsibility to create, seek, and state 
knowledge freely and openly and to strive for scholarly excellence. The scholar has the right and 
responsibility to exercise critical self-discipline and judgment in generating, using, extending, and

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 14 ===
transmitting knowledge, to adhere to the highest standard of intellectual honesty, and to oversee 
and evaluate the research and creative efforts of students and subordinates. Faculty shall conduct 
all activities of scholarship and creativity in a manner consistent with accepted scholarly 
standards and in conformity with legal, professional, and University codes, policies, and 
regulations governing scholarship and creative endeavors. 
d. Public Service 
ADA University is committed to public service as an integral aspect of its mission; this 
entails a commitment to the creation, dissemination, and application of knowledge. 
Public service involves the application of the faculty member's professional training and 
competence to issues and problems of significance to constituencies and it is related to academic 
program objectives of the unit(s) in which the faculty member is appointed. Faculty members 
engaging in public service activities enjoy the same rights and have the same responsibilities 
which were previously stated as pertaining to them as teachers and scholars. 
Faculty members, in accordance with University policy and regulations, can serve as 
valuable resources and provide valuable services by working with government, industry, public 
organizations, and others off-campus. Faculty members have the right to engage in a limited 
amount of outside work for pay in accordance with the University policy and regulations. 
e. Relation with Colleagues 
As colleagues, faculty members have rights and responsibilities that derive from 
common membership in a community of scholars. Faculty have the responsibility to respect and 
right to defend the free inquiry of associates and, in the exchange of ideas and criticism, the 
responsibility to respect the views and rights of others. Faculty members shall acknowledge the 
contributions of colleagues to their own work. In the evaluation of the professional 
performance of a colleague, the faculty member shall provide an honest and objective appraisal 
in accordance with established school and University criteria. The faculty member shall foster 
collaboration with and support of colleagues. Acts of racism or sexism, including harassment 
and other forms of bias and discrimination, violate University policies, and are unacceptable. 
f. Relation to the University and the Community 
As members of ADA University, the faculty have a primary responsibility to strive for 
academic excellence in instruction, scholarship, and public service. When the situation 
warrants, faculty members acting or speaking as citizens have a responsibility to make clear that 
these actions and utterances are entirely their own and not those of the University or any 
component of the University. Faculty members have the responsibility not to abuse their 
standing within the University for personal or private gain, nor use University employees, 
facilities, equipment, supplies, or other property for personal or private business. 
As a member of the wider community, the faculty member has the rights and obligations 
of any citizen. In exercising these rights, the faculty member speaks only as an individual, either 
as a professional scholar with a field of special competence or as a private citizen. 
Faculty members should be mindful that membership in the academic community

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 15 ===
inevitably involves identification and association with the University and that the University 
often is judged by the actions, performance, attitudes, and expressions of its faculty members. 
Faculty members normally do not face a conflict between the exercise of their rights as a citizen 
and their responsibilities as a faculty member. If citizenship activities interfere with faculty 
responsibilities, faculty members should request a leave of absence, resign from their 
appointment, or limit those activities to ensure a complete discharge of faculty responsibilities. 
g. Resolution of Conflicts 
The University is committed to respect the rights of the faculty. Faculty members who 
believe that their rights have been violated have the right to seek redress through the University's 
established procedures for the hearing and resolution of complaints. Faculty members have the 
obligation to meet their responsibilities as defined in this document to help the University 
maintain academic excellence and realize its goals. Faculty members accused of failing to meet 
these responsibilities have a right to be informed of the accusations and accorded timely access 
to the University procedures to determine whether the accusations are valid and any sanctions 
justified. 
 
General Condition of Faculty Appointment 
At ADA University, we have two categories of full-time faculty: core and core-line 
faculty. 
Core-line faculty are those who serve in the rank of Assistant Professor or Instructor and 
are progressing toward promotion. Core faculty are those who have served in the rank of 
Assistant Professor (if holding a terminal degree) or Instructor (if not holding any terminal 
degree) for 5 consecutive years and have been promoted to the rank of Associate Professor or 
Senior Instructor upon demonstration of successful performance. 
Core faculty appointment serves to protect academic freedom; attract talented individuals 
to a secure life of scholarship/professional contributions, teaching/primary responsibilities, and 
service to others; and assist ADA University to build core faculty to ensure continuity and 
quality. 
The university strives to maximize the number and percentage of full-time faculty in core 
appointments. These appointments enable the university to enhance the quality of teaching and 
retain flexibility in addressing the changing needs of instruction. They may also provide core 
faculty with potential opportunities for continued employment at the University over an extended 
period.

Core and Core-line Faculty 

Professional Obligations 
Core and Core-line faculty members must meet the criteria for high-quality teaching, 
scholarship, and service. A faculty member’s normal yearly obligation is to provide service and 
two semesters or their equivalent of full-time teaching. The faculty members who have earned a 
terminal degree are also expected to engage in scholarship. 
Members of academic units need to coordinate and collaborate when planning how to 
sustain academic programs, working in a collegial atmosphere that fosters excellence in teaching, 
scholarship, and service. Because faculty members play diverse roles, the University has 
established and maintains standards for determining an appropriate and equitable allocation of 
core and core-line faculty obligations in teaching, scholarship, and service. 
In each academic year, the university expects all core and core-line faculty members 
holding terminal degrees to have a workload divided among teaching, scholarship and service as 
defined by the University standards. Core-line faculty members not holding a terminal degree are 
expected to have a workload divided among teaching and service as defined by the University 
standards. 

Teaching 
Generally, assistant professors teach six (6) courses, associate and full professors teach 
five (5) courses and instructors, senior instructors and lead instructors teach eight (8) courses per 
academic year. 
On an annual basis, the Vice-Rector of Academic Affairs in consultation with the 
Dean shall establish overall average course load and credit hour productivity measures for each 
academic unit. The Vice-Rector of Academic Affairs will make this information available for all 
academic units on an annual basis. 
Within the framework of these general policies, the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs 
or designee will recommend appropriate individual teaching assignments based on the mission of 
the academic unit, the faculty member’s contributions to that mission, and the faculty member’s 
involvement in teaching, scholarship, and university service. The Dean of the academic unit must 
approve these assignments of workload. 
When defining a faculty member’s workload assignment for an academic year, the 
academic unit may consider the following: evidence of an active scholarly agenda and 
productivity; the scope and intensity of course preparation; supervision of student 
scholarship, internships and/or thesis; credit hours taught; size of classes; teaching-related 
activities, such as contact hours, advising, laboratory time, and fieldwork; and significant 
contributions to service (such as major committee assignments) at the University and beyond. 
Such external service must be clearly related to the teaching and scholarly interests of the faculty 
member and/or advances the academic reputation of the academic unit or University.

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 17 ===
In the interest of transparency, the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs will prepare a 
summary of the faculty effort by academic unit and will make it available to all faculty. 
 
Scholarship 
Faculty members’ thorough understanding of and significant contribution to their 
field are essential to the mission of the University and to the advancement of knowledge. All 
academic units must have criteria that require creative, scholarly, and professional achievements 
of the highest quality and with national or international impact. The University shall base its 
assessment of a faculty member’s achievements on the aggregate productivity and impact of the 
work since degree completion, including evidence that the faculty member has been productive 
at ADA University and continues to be an active scholar. Growth in the breadth and depth of 
scholarship beyond that of the dissertation research and resulting publications, or other work 
performed as part of the faculty member’s obligations for the terminal degree, is a useful 
demonstration of active and continuing scholarly activity. It is responsibility of the faculty 
member to be engaged into scholarship activity. 
Scholarship here is defined as the scholarship of discovery, application, integration, and 
teaching. Such scholarship leading to the advancement of knowledge resulting in certain type of 
publication and activities is an expectation of faculty. The work also should relate directly to the 
criteria established by the university in its policy on evaluating scholarly activity. 
 
Service 
 
The third component of faculty members’ professional obligation is service, which 
includes service to the university and service to the community. This responsibility involves a 
general contribution, over and above teaching and scholarly activity. 
 
Service to the University 
Engagement at ADA University is an essential component of faculty responsibility. 
Beyond the student-based responsibilities, faculty members are encouraged to participate in 
major campus-wide events, particularly opening convocation, and graduation, and willingly 
accept service roles that arise when classes are not in session or faculty members are not 
teaching. These roles may include, for example, recruitment or orientation activities, faculty 
hiring committees, or other university business or committee work that must be conducted 
outside of the normal fall and spring academic semesters, including service on the Faculty 
Council, University Senate, and Committee on Faculty Affairs. Such service makes a critical 
contribution to the well-being of the academic community. Each academic unit must establish 
guidelines for evaluating service to the university. 
 
Service beyond the University 
 
Faculty often provide service to local, national, and/or international communities as well 
as hold leadership positions in scholarly associations. Such activities demonstrate an individual’s 
acceptance of the responsibilities that come with being a member of the faculty in a university 
deeply committed to service to a wider community. Such service must be clearly related to the

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 18 ===
teaching and scholarly interests of the faculty member and/or advances the academic reputation 
of the academic unit or university. Service beyond the university cannot substitute for a service 
contribution to the university but may count toward faculty members’ fulfilling their workload 
obligation. Each academic unit must establish guidelines for evaluating service beyond the 
university. 

Academic Ranks and Qualification 
 
Academic ranks and qualification differ for those who come as core-line faculty with 
terminal degree and those who come without terminal degree. Academic unit must recommend 
all full-time, core-line appointments to the faculty of the recommending unit. In addition to 
fulfilling the general criteria for the evaluation of faculty members described in the following 
section, faculty must meet specific requirements for each rank to be appointed to or promoted to 
that rank. 
 
Core-line Faculty 
 
The core-line faculty are the faculty who would have served 5 years continuously at ADA 
University since their initial appointment. Qualifications and conditions of each category are 
following. 
 
Core-line faculty with terminal degrees 
 
• 
Assistant Professor 
In most circumstances, an appointee to this rank holds an earned doctorate or the highest 
degree customary in the field. In extraordinary circumstances, an appointee may have 
professional experience equivalent to the highest degree in the field. In all cases, the appointee 
demonstrates the potential to achieve excellence in teaching/primary responsibilities and 
scholarly activities and demonstrates the promise of future professional growth in the field. An 
appointee also has the potential to participate in internal and external service and to mentor and 
advise students. 
 
• 
Associate Professor and Full Professor 
Academic units may hire Associate Professor and/or Full Professor as a core-line faculty 
for their initial appointment. Such faculty would have been eligible to obtain a core faculty status 
after a) five continuous years of service and b) successful review at ADA University. 
 
Core-line faculty without terminal degrees 
 
• 
Instructor 
For faculty members who do not hold a terminal degree in their field, the rank of Instructor is a 
temporary one-year renewable appointment. The University usually appoints these faculty members to 
provide instruction to undergraduate students. Reappointments are subject to annual evaluation. 
Academic units evaluate instructors primarily on their teaching and, if applicable, service to the 
academic unit.

ADA University

Core Faculty 
 
The core faculty are the faculty who would have served 5 years continuously at ADA 
University and would have been promoted to the next academic rank. Qualifications and conditions of 
each category are following 
 
Core faculty with terminal degree 
 
• 
Associate Professor 
In addition to meeting the criteria for the rank of assistant professor, the faculty member 
demonstrates high quality as a teacher; engagement with students in and outside the classroom; 
significant scholarly accomplishments appropriate to the field; professional recognition and growth; 
and potential for a career of excellence in teaching, sustained scholarly distinction and/or prominent 
accomplishments in service. Customarily, the faculty member has a significant proven record of 
teaching/primary responsibilities, of participating in internal and external service, and of mentoring and 
advising students. 
 
• 
Professor 
In addition to meeting the criteria for the rank of associate professor, the faculty member 
demonstrates continuing excellent scholarship and/or prominent accomplishments in the field, high-
quality teaching/performance of primary responsibilities, continuing active engagement with students 
in and outside the classroom, continuing relevant and effective internal and external service, and 
evidence of the potential to sustain excellence in all these areas. 
 
Core faculty without terminal degree 
 
• 
Senior Instructor 
Faculty members are awarded the rank of Senior Lecturer if they (1) have demonstrated 
successful teaching in the rank of Instructor for a period of five continuous years, and (2) do not hold 
the terminal degree in the field. An academic unit may also appoint to this rank those who have 
comparable professional experience. After five years of service, Senior Instructors are eligible for 
promotion to a rank of Lead Instructor. 
 
• 
Lead Instructor 
The rank of Lead Instructor recognizes the contributions of faculty members who have served 
in the rank of Senior Instructor and have demonstrated superior performance as a teacher. An academic 
unit may also appoint to this rank those who have comparable professional experience. Lead instructor 
evaluation is primarily on basis of teaching performance and, if applicable, service to the academic 
unit. 
In case a faculty member in the rank of Senior/Lead instructor is transferred from one 
academic unit to another, the decision on the rank in the new academic unit shall be made based 
on the teaching and professional experience relevant to the field.

ADA University

Contractual Terms of Service 
 
Initial Appointment 
 
 Initial appointments for core-line faculty are usually for three years. In instances 
when the performance of a faculty member under an initial contract is substantially less than 
satisfactory, the academic unit will provide guidance and support so that the faculty member has 
an opportunity to improve. In these instances, the Dean will notify the faculty member in writing 
of such concerns. In extraordinary circumstances, upon the recommendation of the Dean, the 
Vice-Rector of Academic Affairs may, before the three-year contract expires, dismiss a core-line 
faculty member who, despite guidance and support, persists in unsatisfactory performance. This 
unusual action would normally, but not always, be related to teaching/performance of primary 
responsibilities. A faculty member dismissed for unsatisfactory performance during the initial 
appointment term is not entitled to the grievance process. 

Reappointment 
Faculty, who would have served at ADA University for 3 consecutive years, may be 
eligible for reappointment. Reappointments prior to the granting of core faculty status are 
usually for two years. Reappointments are contingent upon the satisfaction of the general criteria 
for the evaluation of faculty members, of the specific criteria set by the individual academic unit, 
and of the criteria outlined in the “Academic Ranks and Qualifications” section of this 
Handbook. 
The reappointment of a core-line faculty member to the sixth year of service is not 
allowed unless that faculty member has been successfully promoted to the next rank and earned a 
core faculty status. 

Notice for Appointment or Termination 
Each academic unit will state the precise terms and conditions of all appointments in 
writing for each appointee. The letter of appointment will include a specific reference to this 
Handbook, which is available online. It is the faculty member’s responsibility to be familiar 
with his/her rights, responsibilities, and obligations as stated in this Handbook. 
Appointments of faculty for the first five years of core-line service are for a specified 
term or duration. This means that these appointments naturally expire on the end date of the 
term, unless the appointments are terminated earlier as provided by the Handbook, without 
further University action. Nevertheless, it is the intention of the University that all core-line 
faculty members be advised by letter as soon as possible in the final academic year of service in 
which their appointment expires whether they will be reappointed, and in cases of 
reappointment, the terms and conditions thereof. 
Only the VRAA may reappoint core-line faculty for a succeeding term and does so in 
writing. Failure to receive notice does not imply reappointment or the award of core faculty. If a 
faculty member has not received notice of renewal or grant of core faculty, it is the faculty

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 21 ===
member’s responsibility to inquire of the VRAA, through the Dean, who will respond with a 
status report. 
 
Promotion in Rank 
 
Recommendations for the promotion of core-line faculty must be in accord with the 
provisions of the core system and provide the same procedural protections that are provided to 
non-core faculty. Timelines for promotion are defined as 5 years for Assistant Professor and may 
range from 5 to 8 years for Associate Professor. 

Appointment of Core-Line Faculty 
ADA University is deeply committed to a diverse faculty. Academic units must 
demonstrate that they have vigorously taken steps to fulfill the commitment to diversity and will 
be held accountable by means of a clearly articulated diversity strategy included in the 
recruitment plan filed with the VRAA at the time of approval to search. 
Academic units must request authorization from the Vice-Rector of Academic Affairs for 
searches to hire core-line faculty members at the instructor, assistant, associate, or full professor 
rank. 
For all core-line appointments, the academic unit must demonstrate that it has conducted 
a full and careful search, including evidence that the candidate has the strong support of the 
faculty members of the unit for the specified rank, along with concurrent support from the Dean 
and any other review bodies of the University, as well as the potential for sustained significant 
contributions in the areas of teaching/primary responsibilities, scholarship and service. 
While all faculty members who vote on core-line hires must be core or core-line faculty 
members, the University also requires that such faculty should be at a rank higher than that of the 
candidate. In cases when this is not possible, the Vice Rector of Academic Affairs decides on the 
hire in consultation with the Dean of the academic unit. 
If academic unit completes its full search process and seeks to recommend appointing a 
core-line faculty member, the unit must undertake additional due diligence to ensure that the 
candidate will meet the standards expected of a core-line faculty member in terms of 
teaching/primary responsibilities, scholarship and service at ADA University and be an effective 
colleague in assisting the overall development of the academic unit. Hiring at this level demands 
more than a demonstration of achievements commensurate with the rank; it also requires 
evidence that the individual possesses qualities that positively distinguish her or his career and 
that hold additional promise for ADA. 
Having completed its search process, the academic unit presents its report simultaneously 
to the Vice Rector of Academic Affairs and the Committee of Faculty Affairs (CFA). Both the 
VRAA and the CFA will review the documentation, consult with the Dean, and interview the 
candidate. The feedback of the CFA is important before the University makes an offer. 
If an offer is to be made, it will include determination of core-line status and rank.

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 22 ===
Should circumstances require unusual action outside normal procedures, the Vice Rector of 
Academic Affairs should, to the extent possible, consult with the faculty of the academic unit, 
appropriate administrators, and the CFA. Under such circumstances, the VRAA will provide a 
written explanation to all parties involved. 
Once appointed, faculty will customarily receive core-line faculty status. 

Review of Core-Line Faculty 
Majority of faculty will seek core faculty status during the final year of the standard five-
year core-line period. Core-line faculty on the standard five-year track are reviewed at the 
University level during the third and fifth years of service by the Vice Rector of Academic Affairs, 
the Dean of the School, the Committee of Faculty Affairs and the Associate Dean of Academic 
Affairs. 
The third-year review, called the Initial Review, is an important step in determining if the 
faculty member is making a sufficient progress toward core faculty. The fifth-year review, called 
the Core Review, assesses the candidate’s record so that a final recommendation regarding 
promotion and core faculty status can be made to the Vice-Rector of Academic Affairs. 
The final decision to promote or to grant core faculty status rests with the Rector of 
University. Core status and promotion will typically be granted in and effective with the next 
annual contract. 

Delay of Core Review 
 
A core-line faculty member may request a one-year extension of time for review and 
promotion based on personal or professional circumstances that substantially impede his or her 
expected professional development as defined by the Faculty Handbook guidelines for 
promotion. The University may grant a maximum of 2 one-year extensions, customarily only if 
each relates to a different initiating event or set of circumstances. Sample list of professional and 
personal circumstances that might support a delay of core faculty status consideration follows: 
 
a. Unforeseeable disruptions to major scholarly efforts that are beyond the control of 
the faculty member. 
b. Death or acute illness of a co-author. 
c. Major loss due to acts of nature - including floods, fire, earthquake, etc. 
d. Military service. 
e. Illness or injury to the faculty member. 
f. Faculty member’s primary caregiver role in the following examples of acute family 
responsibilities: 
i. Childbirth or adoption. 
ii. Care of ill or injured member of faculty member’s immediate family. 
iii. Death of an immediate family member.

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 23 ===
Requests for delay of promotion and core faculty status should be submitted to the Dean 
within 6 months of the qualifying event. Within 10 business days thereafter, the 
recommendations of the Dean should be submitted to the VRAA for decision. Unless the VRAA 
determines that extraordinary circumstances are presented, the “core faculty clock” may not be 
stopped in the fifth year (or the year of the Core Review). 
 
Credit for Prior Service 
 
Qualified candidates may elect to take up to two years of prior service towards core 
faculty status at ADA University. Extensions of credit for prior service beyond two years must 
be approved by the VRAA in consultation with the academic unit, the appropriate Dean, and the 
Rector. This service credit may be based on experience at another institution, generally one of 
higher learning, but may include service at other types of appropriate institutions. 
Candidates given credit for prior service shall be required while at ADA University to maintain 
at least the level of scholarly work and teaching excellence for which credit was awarded. Initial 
contracts will clearly state the credit awarded for prior service and the anticipated schedule for 
Core Review. 
 
Faculty Seeking an Early Core Review 
 
Faculty with an exceptional record may apply for core faculty prior to completing the 
entire fifth-year review period. In such instances, the faculty member must have the support of 
their unit’s comparable unit-level review committee, their unit’s Dean and the Vice Rector of 
Academic Affairs. Customarily, such a request would not be made prior to the completion of the 
third-year Initial Review. Faculty who files for an early Core Review go through the standard 
review described in this Handbook, though it may be accelerated in those instances in which the 
university must conduct a review to meet a counteroffer to a valued faculty member from another 
university. As in other instances, the core status decision is final, and the candidate cannot 
reapply for core status again. 

Evaluation of Faculty 
 
 Criteria for Evaluation 
 
Every faculty action should serve to enhance the quality of the university. Faculty members 
must demonstrate effective teaching/effectiveness in fulfilling primary responsibilities, significant 
scholarship, and a willingness to assume a fair share of service. There must also be evidence of the 
ability and commitment to continued advancement in all areas. As members of the learned profession 
responsible for educating the future citizenry, the university expects faculty members to exhibit 
civility, collegiality, and respect for different points of view and diversity in the academic 
community. 
 
To achieve these objectives, the University defines the expectations for the overall 
contributions of each faculty member. These expectations are outlined in the following documents:

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 24 ===
1. The University Policy on the Evaluation of Teaching Effectiveness 
2. The University Policy on the Evaluation of Scholarly Activity 
3. The University Policy on the Evaluation of Service 
 
At the beginning of each academic year, faculty should sign a Position Responsibility 
Statement (PRS) defining the primary responsibilities of faculty and expected outcomes for the 
academic year. PRS serves as the main document for faculty evaluation. No full-time faculty should 
start their academic year without PRS. 
 
Each PRS should be as specific as possible about outcomes, goals, and objectives and 
how success will be demonstrated. At the end of each academic year faculty should fill in the 
Self-evaluation form, which should include an evaluation of successes and explanations of lack 
of success for those outcomes, goals, and objectives specified in this year’s PRS. As well as 
being a summative assessment of the past year’s performance, such a retrospective can help a 
faculty member’s Dean understand those obstacles in the path of achieving specified outcomes 
and may be used to identify faculty development opportunities or changes in unit procedures that 
will further faculty success. 
 
 Schedule for Evaluation 
Evaluation of faculty is not the same as Review of faculty. 
Evaluation of core and core-line faculty is done at the school level by the Dean of the 
academic unit. Evaluation of Core-line Faculty is done annually at the end of each academic 
year, while evaluation of Core Faculty is done biannually, at the end of every other academic 
year. 
Meanwhile, Review of faculty is administered at the University level, in accordance with 
the review schedule outlined in this handbook. 
 
Policy and Procedures on Core Review 
 
Basis of internal review 
Faculty members of academic unit are responsible for determining if a candidate’s 
performance contributes significantly to the field and raise the academic quality of the 
University. Faculty participation in the process is essential. The seriousness of this responsibility 
must be apparent in the depth and thoroughness with which faculty members conduct reviews for 
appointments, reappointments, promotion in rank and to core status at every level. 
At all stages of the process, reviewer recommendations should be objective, 
substantiated, and balanced, regardless of the conclusion. Any recommendation from the 
academic unit Dean or designated committees should: 
 
a. provide a thorough analysis of strengths and weaknesses rather than simply 
advocating a conclusion; 
b. anticipate and discuss questions that others may raise later in the process when

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 25 ===
applicable, summarize the reasoning of both the majority and minority. 
 
A negative recommendation from academic unit will customarily result in the unit’s 
retention of a core-line position. An exception to this instance must be in writing and provided 
to all parties involved; however, the allocation of all faculty position remains under the authority 
and discretion of the VRAA. 
 
Confidentiality and Conflicts of Interest 
Faculty participating in the process at any stage must respect its confidentiality and 
cannot reveal to anyone the votes, names or views of reviewers, contents of discussions, or 
contents of the file. Breaches of confidentiality may subject a faculty member to disciplinary 
action. Academic units should take appropriate steps to maintain confidentiality. Broad 
electronic distribution of the file is unwise. 
Faculty members should always avoid conflicts of interest involving the evaluation of 
individual faculty members for appointment, reappointment, or promotion. The University 
expects the VRAA, Deans, members of the Committee on Faculty Affairs, and all other internal 
faculty reviewers to acknowledge such conflicts openly and to abstain from participation 
whenever such conflicts arise. In the interest of fairness, the principle is that no person shall have 
more than a single vote in the evaluation of a faculty member. 
 
External Review 
Following the guidelines posted by the Office of VRAA, each academic unit should 
obtain qualified external reviewers before internal reviews begin. Consistent with these 
guidelines, the file should contain a minimum of three letters solicited by the academic unit 
Dean. Prior to solicitation of external letters, the Dean will provide the list of potential reviewers 
to the VRAA for comment. 
The external reviewers should be nationally or internationally respected individuals 
whose area of expertise qualifies them to speak with authority about the candidate and whose 
professional and personal relationship with the candidate is such that the external reviewers can 
provide an objective review. Customarily, majority of these letters must be from faculty 
members, typically full professors, who are affiliated with highly regarded institutions. 
The promotion file that includes the external letters will also include, along with the 
reviewer’s letters, a copy of the letter/email used to solicit the reviews and a brief c.v. or 
statement of the external reviewers’ qualifications and statement as to why they were selected, 
should that not be obvious. 
Internal Review 
Each academic unit should provide written procedures for the internal review of 
candidates’ files. With exception of academic unit Deans, all faculty members who vote in 
reviews for promotion to the professor ranks or for core must be core faculty and, preferably, 
hold a rank higher than that of the candidate.

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 26 ===
In all cases, eligible senior faculty are to vote on a candidate’s file unless there is a 
demonstrable conflict of interest (e.g. nepotism) or a proven history of animus by the senior 
faculty member directed toward the candidate. The process for voting and review is clearly 
defined. Voting must be by secret ballot. Each eligible faculty member will provide a separate 
positive, negative, or abstaining vote on each of the criteria of teaching/primary responsibilities, 
scholarship, and service, and on the overall recommendation. 
In all cases, the file must include the following elements: 
 
a. a vote count for each of the criteria; 
b. a written recommendation from the Dean of the academic unit; 
c. a written recommendation from the Committee on Faculty Affairs; 
d. the candidate’s curriculum vitae; 
e. a personal statement by the candidate of goals and objectives as well as accomplishments 
for each criterion; 
f. required teaching evaluations; 
g. publications (need not be a copy of everything, but at least the more notable 
publications in the opinion of the candidate); 
h. external letters with appropriate supporting materials outlined in the previous section. 
 
Dean’s Review 
Upon receipt of the candidate’s file, the Dean reviews faculty action procedures to ensure 
that they conform to the requirements of this Handbook and to the criteria the academic unit 
specifies. The Dean may choose to request clarifying information from relevant persons involved 
in the review at earlier stages. The Dean may also request additional information and if 
needed return the file for additional external letters that will be reviewed at the previous levels. 
Such requests and any responses (or summaries thereof) must be included in the file. 
 
Committee of Faculty Affairs Review 
The committee will review the file and the previous recommendations. In the interest of 
equity, the committee will also determine if the file has been handled according to the written 
procedures of the unit and the Handbook. The committee may choose to request additional 
information from relevant persons involved in the review at earlier stages. Such requests and any 
responses (or summaries thereof) must be included in the file. 
The CFA chair will write a recommendation that reports the vote count for each of the 
criteria and reflects the deliberations of the committee, including the majority and minority 
opinions, regarding the strengths and weaknesses identified in the file. Voting must be by secret 
ballot. 
Each eligible CFA member will provide a separate positive, negative, or abstaining vote on 
each of the criteria of teaching/primary responsibilities, scholarship, and service, and on the overall 
recommendation. If a member of the CFA is eligible to vote on a faculty action at the unit level of 
review, the CFA member will vote at the unit level of review and will not vote at the CFA level of 
review. In that case, the CFA member will serve as an informational resource for the CFA.

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook

=== PAGE 27 ===
Vice Rector of Academic Affairs Review 
The Vice Rector of Academic Affairs will review files for reappointment before the final 
core faculty status decision is made. For files concerning promotion, the Vice Rector of 
Academic Affairs will determine if the file is complete, thorough, and ready for review. The 
Vice Rector of Academic Affairs will review the file and may request clarifying or additional 
information from relevant persons or committees involved in the review at earlier stages. In 
extraordinary circumstances, the VRAA may request additional external review letters that will 
be reviewed at the previous levels. Such requests and any responses (or summaries thereof) must 
be included in the file. 
If recommending promotion, core faculty status, or both, the VRAA will inform the 
Rector of the recommendation and will forward the recommendation to the Rector for approval. 
A decision by the VRAA to deny promotion or core faculty status terminates the process. The 
faculty member can grieve the decision. 
The VRAA's final decision must be in writing, and, if the VRAA’s decision differs from 
that of earlier recommendations in the file, the VRAA should explain the bases for the faculty 
action. The final written decision must be transmitted to the Committee on Faculty Affairs, the 
Dean of the applicable academic unit, the committee (s), and the candidate. 
 
The Rector 
The candidate is awarded core faculty status or promotion only upon the approval of the 
Rector. 

Policy and Procedures on Post-Core Review 
The faculty and administrators of ADA University are dedicated to the pursuit of 
excellence in teaching, scholarship, and service. It is the role of the Dean to conduct 
evaluations of core faculty members, to identify the area or areas in which a particular core 
faculty member has not met expectations, to explain the rationale for that assessment, and to 
facilitate faculty development as needed to improve faculty performance. To this end, the post-
core review process is intended to be developmental rather than punitive. 
A core faculty who receives an evaluation from the Dean stating that he or she has a 
serious deficiency in teaching, scholarship and/or service should be aware that a second 
evaluation from the Dean which states that he or she has not met expectations in terms of overall 
performance in the three areas of responsibility could activate the Post-Core Review process. 
It is the responsibility of the Dean to meet within 30 days with the faculty member who 
has received such an evaluation to present in writing and clarify through discussion the 
deficiencies identified in the evaluation. The Dean should also outline in writing the steps to be 
taken, the required outcomes, and the points in time at which progress will be assessed, in order 
for the faculty member to correct identified deficiencies, and thus, meet expectations in 
subsequent reviews. The Dean will also notify the faculty member in question that his or her 
subsequent evaluation will be issued no later than January 15 of the following year.

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 28 ===
The Dean’s expectations for improvement in all areas of deficiency will be documented 
in a Professional Development Plan which specifies actions to be taken by the faculty member, 
outcomes sought, a timetable for these actions, and agreed-upon means of both achieving the 
desired ends and evaluating progress and/or completion of these remedial steps. The Dean and 
faculty member will co-sign the Professional Development Plan and a copy will be provided to 
the VRAA. So long as the faculty member is acting in good faith to achieve the goals outlined in 
the Plan, s/he will be treated as a valued member of the core faculty with all rights and privileges 
pertaining there to and may rely on the Dean to provide reasonable assistance in achieving the 
goals of the Plan. Failure to seriously and conscientiously address the actions agreed upon in the 
Plan or unwillingness to participate in the development of a Plan will be sufficient in and of 
itself for initiation of withdrawal of core faculty status and termination of employment with due 
notice. 
If the Post-Core Review policy is activated, the faculty member must be notified in 
writing by the Dean. Post-Core Review cannot be activated unless the pattern of deficiency has 
been noted in two evaluations. 
Confidentiality 
The confidentiality of the post-core review process must be maintained. When the 
decision is made to place a faculty member under post-core review, discussion of the post-core 
review candidate and the process should be limited to the Dean and VRAA, the Rector, and the 
core faculty member placed under post-core review. With the approval of the faculty member 
undergoing post-core review, other individuals may be involved in various aspects of the 
professional development plan for a purpose of mentoring the faculty member under review. 
Care should be taken to involve in the plan only those individuals who agree to respect the 
essential confidentiality of the post-core review process. 
Procedures 
The Dean must recommend initiation of the post-core review process no later than 
January 15. The decision of the Vice Rector of Academic Affairs on whether to support the 
post-core review process for the faculty member must be made no later than March 1. 
When the post-core review process has been activated, the Dean will conduct an in-depth 
evaluation. In addition to examination of the teaching, scholarship, and service record of the 
faculty member from previous evaluations, the Dean should evaluate the overall contribution of 
the faculty member to the University. Consideration and assessment of a faculty member's 
performance in post-core review must include all aspects of the faculty member's performance 
and cannot be limited to teaching. With respect to teaching, the total evaluation of teaching must 
include evaluation by peers, student opinion surveys and at least one other method. If 
requested by the faculty member, the Dean, one or more external evaluators may be 
brought into the process. 
In addition to a thorough assessment of faculty performance, a major outcome of this 
process is a strategic development plan indicating the faculty member's expected long-range 
contributions to the University in specific terms. Where deficiencies or areas for possible 
improvement are noted, the strategic development plan should address ways of dealing with 
these problems, measures of expected outcomes, and a timetable for accomplishing these

ADA University

=== PAGE 29 ===
outcomes. The strategic development plan will be written by the faculty member under 
review in consultation with the Dean. The strategic development plan, including measures of 
expected outcomes, if appropriate, will be detailed in a signed agreement among the faculty 
member and the Dean by March 1. The full text of this agreement is submitted to the Vice Rector 
of Academic Affairs. The Vice Rector of Academic Affairs may approve, modify, or reject the 
strategic development plan. The implementation of the strategic development plan is expected to 
take place by March 10. 
If the Dean is unable to solicit the cooperation of the faculty member in the development 
of the strategic plan, the Dean will prepare a plan to which the faculty member will be expected 
to agree by March 1. In the event the individuals involved (Dean and faculty member) are unable 
to reach an agreement on a strategic development plan by March 1, the Dean will report to the 
Vice Rector of Academic Affairs that an agreement has not been found. In such an instance, if 
the Dean and Vice Rector of Academic Affairs concur, a major sanction may be issued to the 
faculty member at this time. If the faculty member refuses to agree to or sign the strategic 
development plan and elects instead to grieve the post-core process, the faculty member must file 
a formal grievance by March 10 and follow the approved timeline for grieving the post-core 
review process. 
The evaluations in succeeding years will specifically address progress toward meeting the 
goals outlined in the agreement on the strategic development plan. A faculty member who fails 
to achieve the outcomes identified in the in-depth evaluation within the agreed-upon timetable 
may be subject to disciplinary actions, including a major sanction and not excluding withdrawal 
of core faculty status and termination with due notice. 

Appeals and Grievance 
 
Appeal of Post-Core Review 
A faculty member who disagrees with the administrative decision to initiate a post- 
core review and develop a strategic plan with a timetable may file a grievance: 
 
• To appeal the initial decision of the Dean recommending post-core review, the 
faculty member must provide supporting documentation to rebut the evaluation to 
the Dean by February 1. 
• The Dean reviews all available information, decides, and notifies the Vice Rector 
of Academic Affairs and the faculty member by February 8. 
• If the faculty member objects to the Dean's decision, he or she may appeal to the 
Vice Rector of Academic Affairs. This appeal must be made by February 15. 
• The Vice Rector of Academic Affairs must act on the faculty member's appeal and 
approve or reject the strategic development plan by March 1. 
 
Grievance of Post-Core Review 
If a faculty member is placed on post-core review, then he or she must combine and 
respond to in one grievance all issues related to the dispute over post-core review: the annual

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University

=== PAGE 30 ===
evaluation, the decision to place the faculty member on post-core review, the requirements of the 
strategic plan, and the imposition of a major sanction, if issued. The faculty member must file 
this grievance by March 10. 
 
Annual Report on Post-Core Review 
The Vice Rector of Academic Affairs will present an annual report to the Deans and the 
University Senate on the number of new and continuing post-core review cases and on their 
general outcome, while carefully respecting the privacy of all faculty members under review and 
the confidentiality of all proceedings. 

Administrators with Faculty Rank 
The assignment to the University administrative or professional staff position and the 
conferring of faculty rank represents separate and distinct actions. A member of the faculty 
whom the University appoints to an administrative or staff position must clearly understand the 
dual nature of the relationship with the University. An individual holding both an administrative 
or staff position and faculty rank is subject to the rules and regulations for both appointments. 
Staff policies will govern administrative and staff actions, and faculty policies will govern 
faculty actions. 
The term “senior administrators” refers to those who are designated as members of the 
Executive Staff. They may include Vice Rector of Academic Affairs, Associate Vice Rectors of 
Academic Affairs, Deans of academic units. 
Faculty members who have gone through a full search process for a senior administrative 
appointment, as specified by the University policies for senior academic administrative hires, 
will customarily have a full background check prior to the offering of an appointment. When the 
University appoints full-time members of the faculty to administrative or staff positions, the 
University expects that they will retain faculty status and be entitled to consideration for 
promotion in rank or an appointment with core faculty status. As long as they have retained 
faculty status and taught in their academic unit, that academic unit and/or any other review 
committee designated by the Rector may submit a written recommendation regarding core 
faculty status and rank directly to the Rector for action. 

Adjunct or Visiting Faculty 
An adjunct faculty appointment allows an individual to contribute to the instructional 
program of academic unit on a part-time basis. The University makes adjunct faculty 
appointments at the rank of adjunct instructor, adjunct senior instructor, adjunct assistant 
professor, adjunct associate professor, and adjunct professor. The term “Visiting” will be 
used for those faculty coming from outside the country. Qualifications for these ranks include 
those comparable to core-line and core faculty ranks.

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 31 ===
Persons may serve as adjunct faculty without limit of time through successive 
reappointment. Adjunct faculty may teach no more than two (2) courses during a given semester. 
Adjunct appointments carry no implications of or credit towards core faculty status. Adjunct 
faculty have access to specific facilities that support their teaching, as provided by the academic 
unit to which they have been appointed. 
 
Professor of Practice 
Professor of practice is a full-time non-tenure-track faculty position for professionals, who 
are fit for academic appointments and focused solely, or mostly, on teaching with little or no 
expectation of engagement in research. Professor of practice is generally required to participate in 
departmental and institutional structures of faculty governance, though they are not entitled to serve 
as department chairs (e.g., Dean or program director) except for executive and clinical programs. 
Professor of practice is equally protected under the conditions of academic freedom, and enjoys 
right to voting, to have reasonably equal salaries, to get leaves, to have job security and to have 
research support. Furthermore, professor of practice is entitled to spend some reasonable amount of 
time in practice outside of the University hours. 
The exemplary list of professionals, eligible for the position of professor of practice, may 
include, inter alia, the former high level public officials, the former CEOs or C-level executives of 
major companies, top policy makers, managing partners, accomplished and well-recognized experts 
in their respective fields, and so on 
For more details refer to the Appendix 5. 

FACULTY PROCESSES 
 
Faculty Appeal 
These procedures apply to appeals related to denials of reappointment, core faculty status 
and promotion. 
A faculty member may appeal (on limited bases) a final action regarding non-renewal 
non-promotion, or denial of core faculty status for reasons stipulated below. All parties involved 
will maintain confidentiality throughout the process and after the process is complete; only 
relevant information will be shared with persons with a legitimate need to know. Breaches of 
confidentiality may subject the person to disciplinary action. 
 
Bases for Appeal 
 
A faculty member may file an appeal for any of the following reasons: 
a. The decision was a result of discrimination contrary to the institutional values or 
prohibited by applicable law;

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 32 ===
b. The decision process materially deviated from the requirements of this handbook or 
other written supplemental criteria and procedures approved by the VRAA, and such 
deviation substantively resulted in negative personnel decision; 
c. Evidence that existed before the VRAA’s decision was not discovered or considered 
either through negligence on the part of a University official or committee, or in spite 
of appropriate diligence on the part of any party to the decision and is likely to 
materially change the outcome of the decision. 

Appeal Process 
 
i. 
The faculty member must notify the Committee on Faculty Affairs in writing of his or 
her intent to file an appeal, with a copy to the VRAA’s Office, within 30 days of 
receiving a decision by the VRAA. The faculty member must state clearly and 
precisely the legitimate grounds for the appeal. 
ii. 
The Committee on Faculty Affairs will conduct a preliminary review of the case to 
determine whether the appeal meets the accepted criteria for appeal including, but not 
limited to, the timeliness of the appeal and legitimacy of the basis for appeal rather 
than a mere disagreement with the decision. If the Committee on Faculty Affairs 
decides that an appeal does not merit review, the Committee will forward its 
recommendation to the Rector with a copy to the faculty member and VRAA. The 
recommendation must state the reasons for not reviewing the appeal. The Rector may 
affirm the Committee’s recommendation or send the case to the Committee for further 
review. 
iii. 
If the Committee on Faculty Affairs conducts a full investigation of the appeal, the 
Committee takes the following steps to evaluate the appeal: (1) review the written 
appeal and supporting documentation, (2) review relevant policies and other 
documents, (3) review the original file, and (4) gather information from individuals 
who have relevant information. In addition, the Committee will invite the grievant to 
meet with the Committee to discuss the investigation. 
iv. 
The Committee review will be guided by the following principles: 
a. The Committee’s role is solely to determine whether sufficient evidence exists 
to support the grounds for appeal and, where appropriate, to recommend 
corrective action. The Committee does not substitute its judgement or decide on 
the merits of the faculty action. In reviewing an appeal, the Committee may not 
make a recommendation for promotion, or reappointment. 
b. Faculty personnel decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. Except in cases 
of alleged discrimination, personnel decisions regarding other faculty are not 
relevant to the Committee’s review. Thus, the Committee will not normally 
have access to the files of other faculty members. After considering the privacy 
interests of the faculty and other parties involved, if the Committee believes 
that access to such files would likely aid materially in the disposition of the 
complaint, the Committee will submit a written request to the VRAA. The 
request for information must describe the basis for the complaint, the issue

Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 33 ===
under review, and the relevance of the comparative files to the complaint. 
v. 
The Committee on Faculty Affairs will submit its findings and recommendations in a 
written report that is supported by a majority vote of the full Committee. The Chair of 
the Committee shall send the report, including the majority and minority views and 
the recommendations supported by the majority to the Rector, VRAA and the faculty 
member within the 14 calendar days after the recommendation is made. 
vi. 
After receiving the report of the Committee on Faculty Affairs, the Rector may 
meet with the faculty member, VRAA or other relevant persons, or take additional 
steps as needed to review the appeal. The Rector will approve, reject, or amend the 
VRAA’s initial decision. The Rector’s decision is final. 
vii. 
The final record of the appeal (including the formal appeal, documentary evidence, 
the Committee’s recommendation, and the Rector’s final decision) will be retained 
under the direction of the Office of the VRAA in accordance with the University’s 
policy on retention of written records. 

Faculty Grievances 
 
Scope 
The University encourages faculty members to resolve their disagreements with the 
University or other faculty members through informal, frank, and open discussion. However, the 
University also recognizes that occasionally more formal processes are needed. Accordingly, 
this grievance policy may be used to resolve grievances within the University by the following 
categories of faculty: 1) full-time faculty and 2) any administrators with faculty status. 
No Retaliation. No individual will be penalized, disciplined, or suffer prejudice against 
for acting, in good faith, exercising the right to make a complaint or for aiding another 
individual in pursuing a complaint. Persons obstructing this grievance process may be 
disciplined up to and including dismissal. Each step outlined below should be taken in a 
timely fashion. 
Confidentially. All parties involved will maintain confidentiality throughout the process; 
only relevant information will be shared with persons with a legitimate need to know. 
Breaches of confidentiality may subject the person to disciplinary action. 

Informal Resolution 
The University encourages individuals to address problems and disputes promptly as 
they arise, through direct discussions. If discussion with a colleague does not lead to a resolution, 
a faculty member or administrator with faculty status may take the matter to the responsible 
administrator. For example, if a grievant has a complaint with respect to a academic unit’s 
action in which the Dean was not involved, the grievant should attempt to resolve the matter 
through discussions with the Dean. If the Dean was involved, the grievant should discuss the 
matter with the VRAA. In general, attempts at resolution should involve the administrator one

Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 34 ===
level above the person(s) whose actions are the source of the complaint. If the grievance cannot 
be resolved by the responsible administrator or if the grievant does not want to involve such an 
administrator, then the grievant may submit a written request to the VRAA for assistance in 
resolving the matter informally. If a conflict of interest prevents the VRAA from facilitating 
resolution, he or she may appoint a designee. The person who will facilitate the resolution may 
consult with relevant individuals, review relevant documents, and attempt to resolve the matter 
informally. 
If the complaint cannot be resolved informally, the grievant may then file a grievance 
with the Committee on Faculty Affairs. However, an informal resolution can occur at any time, 
even after the formal process has been initiated. 
 
Handling of Grievances 
 
a. Filling of Formal Grievance 
The formal written grievance should consist of the grievant written statement concerning 
the substance of the complaint, the history of attempts to resolve it, and the relief sought. It 
should include the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of the grievant and a preliminary 
list of individuals who may have information relevant to the deliberations of the Committee on 
Faculty Grievances. 
 
b. Preliminary Action 
If acceptable to both parties, the chair of the Committee on Faculty Affairs may attempt 
to resolve the problem without involving the full committee. If a resolution is reached, both 
parties and the committee will receive a written report from the chair of the Committee on 
Faculty Affairs. If an informal resolution cannot be reached, then the grievant can request from 
the Committee a review of the formal complaint. 
 
c. Committee’s Review 
The committee on faculty affairs will investigate the complaint through discussions with 
relevant parties and consideration of relevant documents. Relevant parties will include the 
grievant, the person(s) whose actions form the substance of the complaint, and any other person 
who may have information that the committee deems relevant. The committee may request or 
invite additional documentation from relevant parties, and it may invite relevant parties to meet 
with it. It will require all parties whom it contacts to keep the matter confidential. 
 
d. Committee’s Report and Disposition 
The Committee on Faculty Affairs will record its findings and recommendations in a 
written report. The Office of VRAA is available for consultation throughout the grievance 
process. Ordinarily the committee will submit the report and a copy of the grievance to the 
VRAA and send a copy of the report to the grievant. If the VRAA is the subject of the complaint 
or has had substantial involvement in the issues giving rise to the complaint, the committee will 
submit the report and a copy of the grievance to the Rector instead of the VRAA. The grievant 
will have one week to submit to the VRAA (or, if the report was submitted to the Rector, the

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 35 ===
Rector) a written response to the report. 
Following review of the report, the VRAA (or Rector) will issue a statement to the 
grievant, the person(s) whose actions are the substance of the complaint, and the Committee on 
Faculty Affairs indicating what action will be taken by the University and, if the action is at 
variance with the committee’s recommendation, the reasons for such action. 
The final record of the grievance (including the formal grievance, documentary evidence, 
the final grievance report, and the VRAA’s or Rector’s statement) will be retained under the 
direction of the Office of the VRAA in accordance with the University’s policy on retention of 
written records. 
All grievances will be confidential and adjudicated in an environment of mutual self- 
respect toward all parties. Unwillingness of any participant to follow these restrictions may result 
in their expulsion from the proceedings and appropriate disciplinary measures. Unwillingness on 
the part of the grievant to abide by these restrictions may result, at the will of the committee, in 
suspension or termination of the proceedings. In the latter case, the findings of the VRAA will 
stand and no further appeal, except directly to the Rector, is available to the grievant. 

Disciplinary Actions, Investigations and Hearings 
This section provides a process for investigating and resolving faculty misconduct. If 
disciplinary sanctions are recommended, the disciplinary procedures outlined below will apply. 
When a faculty member fails to fulfill his or her employment obligations or engages in 
misconduct, a collective term defined in the following paragraph, the University will take 
appropriate action. The University’s response to allegations of faculty misconduct may vary 
according to a nature of misconduct, its seriousness, its impact on the University’s reputation or 
the well-being of other members of the ADA community, and prior record of misconduct or 
moral turpitude. 
Misconduct under this policy includes, but is not limited to, incompetence, bullying, 
harassment, discrimination, a pattern, or practice of failing to meet University contractual 
obligations, failure to carry out the obligations of one’s position, violations of honor code and 
University policies, or violations of integrity of a teacher and scholar. 
Disciplinary sanctions apply to any full-time appointment, including, but not limited to, 
one with core faculty status. Disciplinary sanctions fall into two categories: 
 
a) minor sanctions, which include any adverse employment action short of suspension, 
such as a reprimand; 
b) major sanctions, which include suspension or dismissal from employment. 
 
Each step in the informal inquiry and hearing process should be taken in a timely manner.

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 36 ===
Confidentiality of Process 
 
All parties involved will maintain confidentiality throughout the process; only relevant 
information will be shared with persons with a legitimate need to know. Breaches of 
confidentiality may subject the person to disciplinary action. 

Informal Procedures and Resolution 
Any member of the community may initiate an investigation of faculty misconduct by 
informing the appropriate academic unit Dean or designee. The Dean or designee may attempt to 
resolve the issue through an informal process involving all parties to the issue. If informal 
resolution fails or if the Dean determines that the allegation of misconduct has merit and is 
sufficiently serious for disciplinary action, he or she will refer it to the Office of the VRAA. 
 
Resolution by the Vice Rector of Academic Affairs 
The VRAA or designee may consult with parties to the matter before determining the 
initial disposition of the case. The complainant and respondent may each bring a person from the 
ADA University community to attend a meeting with the VRAA, but not to advocate on the 
party’s behalf. The VRAA or designee may also seek external or internal expertise and 
assistance in developing a review of the case. After consultation and consideration of the 
seriousness of the alleged offense, the VRAA or the designee will submit in writing his or her 
findings and recommendations to the Rector, proposing one or more of the following: (1) 
dismissal of the case, (2) informal resolution of the case agreeable to all parties, (3) a minor 
sanction, or (4) a referral to a formal faculty hearing. A recommendation of a minor sanction 
must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. 
The VRAA’s decision to dismiss the case, issue a minor sanction, or otherwise resolve 
the case is final; however, the faculty member may grieve the VRAA’s imposition of a minor 
sanction according to the procedures for filing a grievance. 
Allegations of infractions that result in a minor sanction, such as a reprimand, cautionary 
letter to the file, or short-term financial or administrative remedy, will be reported only to the 
parties to the matter. Minor sanctions will be on file in the Office of the VRAA and will remain 
confidential to protect the respondent’s reputation and relations with colleagues. If the VRAA 
believes that further examination of the charges may result in a major sanction, the VRAA will 
refer the case for a formal faculty hearing. However, the faculty member may waive the right to 
the hearing and choose to have the case decided by the VRAA. In that case, the VRAA’s 
decision will be final and may not be appealed or grieved further. 
 
Procedures for Hearings Which May Result in Major Sanctions or Dismissal 
 
Filing of Statement of Charges for Disciplinary Actions 
The VRAA will notify the faculty member of the intent to file charges and initiate a 
request for a formal hearing panel. The VRAA must file the statement of charges with the

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 37 ===
University Senate chair. The statement of charges must summarize the relevant facts and 
circumstances of the alleged misconduct and include a preliminary list of individuals (and their 
contact information) who may have relevant information. The VRAA will send a copy of the 
statement of charges to the faculty member. The faculty member may elect to present to the 
hearing panel a written statement responding to the charges. 
 
Final Record of Disciplinary Matters 
The chair of the University Senate will convene the Senate Executive Committee as a 
hearing panel and present the members with a general description of the case. The Senate 
Executive Committee is charged with taking special care to achieve a reasonably balanced 
representation regarding the issues involved. Executive committee members deeming themselves 
disqualified for bias or conflict of interest are expected to immediately remove themselves from 
the selection process for panelists on their own initiative. The hearing panel will select a chair. 
A hearing panel has the prerogative to attempt informal resolution before proceeding to a 
formal hearing. If the hearing panel cannot resolve the matter informally, then it will schedule a 
formal hearing. The following general hearing provisions will apply: 
 
1. The hearing panel may modify these procedures, if necessary, for the fair and 
expeditious administration of these proceedings. 
2. The hearing panel will conduct a prehearing conference with the faculty member and 
the VRAA to clarify the issues, stipulate facts, finalize the list of individuals who may 
have information relevant to the hearing, provide for the exchange of documents or 
other information, and identify other appropriate objectives to make the hearing fair, 
effective, and expeditious. The panel will maintain a record of the prehearing 
conference. 
3. The chair of the hearing panel will notify all concerned parties of the time and 
location of the hearing. Notice of the hearing must be in writing and, customarily, 
made at least two weeks prior to the hearing. 
4. Time extension or rescheduling requests by the faculty member or the VRAA may be 
granted by the chair for good cause. 
5. The faculty member may waive the hearing or respond to the specific charges in 
writing at any time before the hearing. In the event the faculty member waives the 
hearing but denies the charges or asserts that the charges do not support a finding for 
a major sanction or dismissal from the University, the panel will hear the case based 
on available evidence directly related to the charges. 
6. Customarily, the hearing will proceed in the absence of either the faculty member or 
the VRAA, if any of them fails to appear at the hearing after receiving notification. 
Only circumstances that are beyond control and that prevent a party’s attendance at 
the hearing will constitute reasonable cause to reschedule the hearing. The hearing 
panel will make the determination as to whether there is reasonable cause for the 
absence. 
7. The charges against the faculty member must be established by a preponderance of

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 38 ===
evidence in the record as a whole. 
8. The full panel must hear the case. 
9. All hearings are closed to the public. The hearing panel, at its sole discretion, may 
remove participants in the hearing who are disruptive to the process. 
10. The hearing panel may invite persons from inside or outside the University to give 
testimony relevant to the matter, and party to the matter may request that the panel 
invite such persons. University personnel will make every effort to cooperate with the 
panel in securing witnesses and making available documents and other evidence. The 
parties shall have the right to cross-examine all witnesses. 
11. Minutes of the hearing will be taken. The VRAA will provide written minutes of the 
hearing to the parties upon request. 
12. After the parties have had an opportunity to review the minutes of the hearing, submit 
closing statements, and make rebuttals to the closing statements, the hearing 
panel will deliberate in closed session and prepare its report. 
13. The findings and recommendations of the hearing panel will be in a written report 
that is supported by a majority vote of the full committee. This report must 
include the majority and minority views and the recommended sanctions supported 
by the majority. The chair of the hearing panel will send the report to the VRAA 
or, if the VRAA has a conflict, to the Rector, and a copy of the report to the faculty 
member. 
14. The VRAA or Rector may approve, reject, or amend such findings and 
recommendations. The VRAA or Rector must state the grounds for his or her action 
in writing to the hearing panel and the faculty member. The decision of the Rector is 
final. 
15. The final record of the hearing, the statement of charges, documentary evidence, the 
final report, and the VRAA’s or Rector’s statement will be retained under the 
direction of the VRAA’s office in accordance with the University’s policy on 
retention of written records. 
16. The VRAA or Rector may suspend a faculty member for an interim period pending 
disciplinary or criminal proceedings (“interim suspension”). An interim suspension 
will be used only in cases where the VRAA determines (1) that the continued 
presence of the faculty member at the University poses a substantial and immediate 
threat to the faculty member or others or to the stability and continuance of normal 
University functions, operations, or processes; or (2) that the continued presence of 
the faculty member would be otherwise demonstrably disruptive. The VRAA may 
also assign the faculty member to alternative duties pending disciplinary or criminal 
proceedings. 
 
Termination of Salary and Benefits 
Termination for cause may follow immediately after the final decision of the VRAA or 
Rector. Final notification of termination will be given in writing to the faculty member within 30 
days after the VRAA’s or Rector’s decision to terminate. The faculty member is not entitled to

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 39 ===
further payment of salary and related benefits, except as required by law, after the effective date of 
termination. 
 
Final Record of Disciplinary Matters 
The final record of disciplinary matters will be retained under the direction of the 
VRAA’s office in accordance with the University’s policy on retention of written records. 

Termination of Faculty Positions Because of Program Elimination 
The University reserves the right to terminate, restrict, or otherwise limit faculty 
appointments, including core appointments, due to program elimination/reorganization (“Program 
Elimination”). Program Elimination includes the discontinuation or reorganization of an academic 
unit, 
undergraduate/graduate 
program, 
or 
certificate 
or 
other 
types 
of 
academic 
program/concentration/track. Program Elimination follows the policies established by the 
University Senate and approved by the VRAA. 
In the event Program Elimination terminates faculty positions, the University will make 
every reasonable effort to place the affected faculty members in other suitable positions in the 
University. The following principles apply: 
• Customarily, a faculty member with core faculty status will not be terminated in favor of 
retaining a faculty member without core faculty status. 
• Customarily, a core-line faculty member with a longer continuous service will not be 
terminated in favor of a core-line faculty member with less continuous service. 
 
Termination of Faculty 
 
The VRAA will provide core and core-line faculty whose appointments are to be terminated 
due to Program Elimination with six months’ written notice prior to the termination of their 
appointments. The notice will include a statement of the basis for the decision. The University may 
shorten or eliminate the period of advance notice by providing equivalent salary and benefits. Core 
and core-line faculty may request review of the termination decision from the Executive Committee 
of the University Senate. 
 
Reinstatement Rights 
 
In all cases in which a core and core-line position has been eliminated due to Program 
Elimination, the University will not fill the position of the faculty member so terminated within two 
years of the University’s decision to eliminate a program, unless the released faculty member has 
been offered reinstatement in that position and has not accepted the offer within a reasonable period 
specified by the University.

INSTRUCTION 
 
Core Competencies and Learning Outcomes 
 
Outcome Images of Our Students 
 
The ideal graduates of ADA will be educated through curriculum built around a triad of 
rigorous major study, functional enablers, and general education, provided with experiential 
learning opportunities through projects and trained to become high-impact graduates. The 
outcome images of these students are, therefore: 
 
1. Highly Intellectual Solution Providers 
2. Close Collaborators 
3. Effective Communicators 
4. Ethical Citizens 
Firstly, producing high impact graduates entails admitting the most qualified students that 
have potential to excel in academically rigorous curricula, developing these students into the 
country’s core manpower with critical thinking, analytical and problem solving skills, and 
ultimately delivering these students to the job market in all sectors of economy – industry, 
government, research or academic institutions – to effectively apply their knowledge and skills. 
Secondly, ADA aspires to produce ‘high impact’ graduates, rather than merely makers. 
High impact graduates are professionals, who are capable of applying their knowledge to solve 
problems and design processes requiring more sophisticated training and skills compared to 
makers whose main functions are carrying out specific tasks. For makers to become high impact 
professionals, it takes skills and knowledge build-up. The academic programs at ADA should 
adopt a project-based learning approach to prepare our students to become high impact graduates 
upon graduation. 
 
Core Competencies and Learning Outcomes 
ADA University has developed a set of Core Competencies which derive from and are 
consistent with our mission, outcome images and strategy. Competence is defined as a specific 
skill and body of knowledge, and the student’s ability to demonstrate that learning in assessment 
while at the University and in workplace upon graduation. 
Each core competence, then, describes the desired Learning Outcome that students should 
be able to accomplish when they graduate, regardless of their program. Some institutions use 
learning objective and learning outcome interchangeably. We prefer to use learning outcome 
because of its direct focus on the result of the student learning. 
 
For more details refer to Appendix 6.

Code of Teaching Responsibility 
 
Satisfaction of teaching responsibilities by faculty is essential to the successful 
functioning of the University. The University conceives these responsibilities to be so important 
that performance by instructors in meeting the provisions of this Code shall be taken into 
consideration in determining salary increases, core status, and promotion. 
 
Course content 
 
Instructors shall be responsible for ensuring that the content of the courses they teach is 
consistent with the course descriptions approved by the University. Instructors shall direct class 
activities toward the fulfillment of top competencies and learning outcomes and shall evaluate 
student performance in a manner consistent with these competencies and outcomes. 
 
Course Syllabi 
During the first week of each semester, the instructor will provide the students with a 
syllabus. The syllabus shall minimally include: 
 
• course description 
• competencies and learning outcomes; 
• instructors contact information and office hours; 
• grading criteria and methods used to determine final course grades; 
• date of the final examination and tentative dates of required assignments, quizzes, and 
tests, if applicable; 
• attendance policy, if different from the University attendance policy and especially when 
that attendance policy affects student grades; 
• required and recommended course materials to be purchased, including textbooks and 
supplies; 
• any required proctoring arrangements to which students must adhere; 
• course outline 
 
Student Assessment 
Instructors shall be responsible for informing students, in a timely manner so as to enhance 
learning, of the grading criteria and methods used to determine grades on individual assignments. 
Instructors shall be responsible for assessing a student’s performance based on announced criteria 
and on standards of academic achievement. Instructors shall submit final course grades in 
accordance with the University deadlines. Assessment methods should be appropriate to the 
learning objectives of the course. In that context, instructors are expected to take reasonable steps 
to create an assessment environment that promotes academic integrity. When proctoring or other 
security measures are necessary to ensure integrity of assessments, then such measures should 
be administered in a manner consistent with the design and delivery of the course.

Grades 
The University believes that regular assessment of students and feedback to them is 
essential to effective teaching and learning. Therefore, faculty members will provide all students 
with evaluation of their progress in a course prior to mid-semester. Faculty will provide specific 
feedback regarding progress in the course by posting an interim grade via Banner or Blackboard 
by the beginning of the seventh week of classes in the fall and spring semesters. 
All faculty must report grades for fall, spring, and summer terms through Blackboard no 
later than 72 hours after the final examination has been given. Final grades are maintained in 
Banner. In no case should the student's name, or any other personally identifiable information be 
posted or released verbally or in written format to anyone other than the student. Any grade 
appeals are regulated by the Student Grievance Policy. 
 
Final Examination 
The University firmly believes that a comprehensive evaluation of a student's achievement 
in a course is a vital part of the educational process. Final examinations are to be given at the time 
determined by the University. Final examinations are normally scheduled in the classroom where 
the course has met throughout the semester. 
In the event a final examination is changed to other than that of the scheduled time, 
provisions will be made by the instructor for any student who cannot comply with the schedule 
change. Any student who has three examinations scheduled in one calendar day and is unable to 
resolve the problem informally with the instructor or instructors may petition the Dean for relief. 
All examinations are to be retained for one semester by the faculty members. Students have the 
privilege of requesting conferences with the instructors to discuss their final grades. 
 
Testing Documents 
 
Instructors shall be responsible for returning answers to quizzes, tests, and examinations to 
students with such promptness to enhance the learning experience. Instructors shall retain final 
examination papers for at least one semester to allow students to review or to retrieve them. All testing 
questions (whether on quizzes, tests, or mid-term or final examinations) are an integral part of course 
materials, and the decision whether to allow students to retain them is left to the discretion of the 
instructor. 
 
Term Papers and Comparable Projects 
 
Instructors shall be responsible for returning term papers and other comparable projects to 
students with sufficient promptness to enhance the learning experience. Term papers and other 
comparable projects are the property of students who prepare them. Instructors shall retain such 
unclaimed course work for at least one semester to allow students to retrieve such work. Instructors 
have a right to retain a copy of student course work for their own files.

=== PAGE 43 ===
Class Meeting and Term 
 
Fall and Spring semesters equal 15 weeks of instruction, while Summer Term equals 12 weeks 
of instruction. Instructors shall be responsible for meeting their classes regularly and at scheduled 
times, within each term. To allow units to take appropriate action, instructors shall notify their units if 
they are to be absent and have not made suitable arrangements regarding their classes. 
 
Class Audit 
 
It is customary for faculty members to allow students or other faculty members to audit classes 
without formality. 
 
Class Attendance by Guest 
 
Non-student presence in the classroom will vary based on many factors. Guidelines specifying 
whether non-student guests will be permitted in the classroom will be established for each class by the 
instructor and included in the syllabus for the course. These guidelines do not apply to senior 
University administrators who are encouraged to attend any class of their own choice at any time. 
 
Applicability of the Code to Student Teaching Assistants 
 
Instructors of courses in which assistants are authorized to perform teaching, or other 
instructional functions shall be responsible for acquainting such individuals with the provisions of this 
Code and for monitoring their compliance. 
 
Instructor Accessibility to Students 
 
Instructors shall be responsible for being accessible to students outside of class time and 
therefore shall schedule and keep office hours for student conferences. Office hours should be 
scheduled at times convenient to both students and instructors with the additional option of 
mutually convenient prearranged appointments for students whose schedules conflict with 
announced office hours. These hours should be communicated on the course syllabus and in other 
appropriate ways to students and teaching unit office personnel. Each academic unit shall determine 
the minimum number of office hours for instructors in that unit. Instructors who serve as academic 
advisorы also shall be responsible for maintaining appropriate office hours before and during 
enrollment periods. In addition to office hours, instructor accessibility through e-mail and other 
means is encouraged. 

Student Evaluation System 
 
Students at ADA University have an interest in being able to make informed judgments in 
selecting courses and faculty members as students pursue their academic programs. To this end, 
the University has framed a set of questions that should provide the type of information that 
students seek. To facilitate the transmission of this information to the students, the following

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 44 ===
procedures are established: 
 
• In compliance with the University policy, at the end of each semester Faculty Affairs 
Department shall administer a standard online form: Student Opinion of Courses and 
Teaching (SOCT) in all the classes through the Blackboard course page 
• Results will be disseminated in summary form and shared with the unit’s Dean or Program 
Director. 
 
Hearing Procedures 
Students may register complaints regarding an instructor's failure to comply with the 
provisions of the Code of Teaching Responsibility directly with that instructor. 
If the concern is not resolved, students may take complaints to academic units' Dean or 
designee. If those persons are unable to resolve matters to the student's satisfaction, 
students may request a formal grievance hearing from the Vice Rector of Academic Affairs. 
Before doing this, all students are encouraged to meet with the VRAA. 
Such complaints must normally be initiated no later than the middle of the semester 
following the one wherein alleged violation occurred. Exceptions shall be made in cases where the 
involved instructor or student is absent from the University during the semester following the one 
wherein alleged violation occurred. 
 
Commercialization of Course Materials 
 
The University prohibits students from commercializing their notes of lectures and 
University-provided class materials without the written consent of the instructor. Instructors may 
allow commercialization by including permission in the course syllabus or other written statement 
distributed to all students in the class. 
 
Participation in Commencement 
 
Commencement ceremonies are held at the end of Spring semester. All faculty are 
required to participate in the commencement ceremony. Deans are responsible for ensuring their 
faculty participate in these ceremonies. 
 
Academic Apparel 
 
Faculty members are expected to provide their own academic apparel for use at 
commencement exercises and other ceremonies when such apparel is appropriate. University 
funds may not be used to purchase academic apparel for individual faculty. A limited number of 
pre-made University gowns may be available for collective use.

SCHOLARSHIP 
The search for new information and understanding is as important to the University as the 
transmission of existing knowledge and understanding. The Office of Vice-Rector of Scholarship 
and Graduate Studies facilitates such endeavors. Basic and applied research are faculty activities 
that are expected and encouraged by the University. 
 
Faculty Research Time 
Research, publication, and other scholarly activities are basic to the objectives and 
responsibilities of the University and its faculty. Recognizing this, the University is committed to 
the concept of research time for faculty to pursue individual intellectual inquiry, to publish, and 
to engage in creative activities designed to improve the educational experience of the students. 
The awarding of time for research is not a routine matter. It is based on an assessment of 
the benefit of significant intellectual activity to the University and provides for regular and 
periodic review of accomplishments. Such time is available to faculty engaged in either graduate 
or undergraduate teaching. 
 
Faculty Time for Founded Research 
 
Wherever possible, the cost of faculty time should be reimbursed to the University from 
grant or contract funds. When required, faculty time may be contributed, especially when the 
funded research has provision for financial support of graduate students or equipment. When 
such cost-sharing of faculty time is agreed to by the University, the contributed time will be 
planned in the schedule of the faculty member. 
 
Faculty Time for Unfunded Research 
External funding is not always available to support the research activities of the faculty. 
To encourage scholarly and creative activities, particularly in certain disciplines, time for 
unfunded research is provided by the academic budget of the University. This time is awarded to 
Core Faculty only, based on a well-developed activity that has the approval of the Dean and the 
Vice Rector of Scholarship and Graduate Affairs. It is essential that such time be based on an 
activity that is both scholarly and of benefit to the University and the faculty member. 
It is essential to demonstrate, through regular and periodic evaluation of the benefits 
derived from unfunded research, that these monies are being spent wisely. It is recognized that 
the results of scholarly activities come to fruition only after a period of two or more years, 
more frequent evaluation of unfunded research time is necessary. Publication in a scholarly 
journal is certainly clear evidence, although not the only evidence, that the research is producing 
desirable results. In extraordinary cases, outside expert review may be solicited to evaluate 
research. 
Under no circumstances a faculty member, who has been awarded unfunded research 
time, may be eligible for extra compensation for teaching a course as overload.

Sponsored Research 
ADA University recognizes the importance of sponsored research in the academic 
development of the faculty and in the training of graduate students. Although research benefiting 
the region is given particular emphasis, the University supports the right of, and encourages, 
faculty members to engage in any sponsored research, so long as that research does not 
compromise the educational objectives established by the University. 
The University's principal research officer is the Vice Rector of Scholarship and 
Graduate Studies. This person has been designated by the Rector of the University as the official 
signatory for the University for all research and sponsored programs. 
The Executive Director of the ADA University Foundation has the responsibility for 
submitting and accepting grants and contracts and establishing and enforcing administrative 
procedures necessary to assure compliance with regulations of funding agencies for operation of 
sponsored projects. The University Foundation is the grantee for projects under its purview, but 
responsibility for technical direction of the project is vested solely in the principal investigator. 
ADA Foundation: https://adafund.org/ 
Since the guidelines are intended to facilitate the research endeavors of the faculty while 
protecting the interests of both the faculty and the institution, exceptions to the procedures 
should be rare and must be with the written approval of the Vice Rector. 
 
Guidelines 
 
University policies relating to sponsored research are based on the following guidelines: 
 
a. Sponsored research to be undertaken must support the instructional and research objectives 
established by the academic units in which the research is to be conducted. Each proposal 
is reviewed, weighing cost against benefit, to determine its appropriateness by Dean(s) and 
Vice Rector of Scholarship and Graduate Studies. 
b. Sponsored research normally is not accepted when the terms and conditions contain 
restrictions that prevent disclosure of the sponsor or the existence of the contract or 
adequate review of suitability to the academic program of the University. 
c. Except under special circumstances, all research grants and contracts are submitted 
through, and administered by, the University Foundation. 
d. Sponsored programs that require matching funds by the University (e.g., equipment) 
will normally be reviewed and approved by the Office of Finance. 
 
Procedures 
 
Preliminary discussions between faculty members and potential sponsors are encouraged 
and often precede the preparation of a formal proposal. The Vice Rector is available for 
discussion at any stage in the preparation of proposals. Formal procedures are based on the 
following guidelines:

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 47 ===
a. A faculty member interested in submitting a proposal should consult with the Dean to 
determine whether the proposed project is desirable with respect to the goals of the 
academic unit. In addition, the faculty member should consult with the Vice Rector on 
application and proposal development guidelines. The Foundation should also be contacted 
for information and assistance in proposal budget preparation. 
b. The faculty member then submits a proposal to the Vice Rector of Scholarship and 
Graduate Studies for administrative review and any necessary modifications in light of 
specific requirements of the University and the proposed sponsor. 
c. The proposal is then prepared for submission by the Foundation; the proposed project 
director is responsible for obtaining signatures of the Dean on the final copy. Proposals 
must be submitted to the Foundation for production not less than five working days 
preceding the project deadline and be accompanied by a signed proposal. 
d. In the event that a proposal is disapproved for submission, the proposing faculty member 
may appeal the decision to the Vice Rector of Scholarship and Graduate Studies for 
reconsideration and decision. The decision of the Vice Rector is final. 
 
All financial reports and statements, property and equipment reports, inventions reports, 
interim and final technical reports, and closeout reports are submitted through the Foundation, 
where copies are retained on file in accordance with grant or contract requirements. 
 
Conflicts of Interests 
Every attempt must be made to avoid conflicts of interests. The following examples 
illustrate potential or actual conflicts of interests. They are by no means exhaustive but are 
illustrative of potential COIs that must be disclosed, avoided, or otherwise managed, reduced, or 
eliminated. 
 
a. Accepting gifts, gratuities, or special favors related to the University research; 
b. Giving remunerated lectures for or on behalf of companies or organizations whose 
economic or political interests are affected or perceived to be affected by an investigator’s 
scholarly work; 
c. Entering a paid consultancy with an entity that has an interest in the consultant’s 
University-based research; 
d. Providing privileged access to information (particularly unpublished research results) 
developed with the University resources or supported by independent sponsors to any 
external entity other than the sponsor; 
e. Undertaking evaluative research when the investigator or the investigator’s immediate 
family member has a financial, managerial, or ownership interest in the sponsoring 
company or in the company producing the product being tested; 
f. Using students or employees of the University to perform services for a company in which 
an individual involved in research activities has an ownership interest or from which 
he/she receives any type of remuneration;

g. Accepting support for research under terms that require results to be held confidential, 
unpublished, or significantly delayed in publication without prior approval of the Vice 
Rector of Scholarship and Graduate Studies; 
h. Purchasing equipment, instruments, or supplies for research or teaching, or contracting 
services from a firm in which the individual involved in research activities has a financial 
or other interest; 
i. Influencing the negotiation of contracts between the University and outside organizations 
in which an individual involved in research activities has a financial interest or other

ACADEMIC HUMAN RESOURCES POLICIES 
 
Appointment Basis and Review Period 
Faculty are appointed on an academic year (AY) basis. An academic year appointment 
covers a full twelve-month period with a nine-month assignment of duties and responsibilities. 
The assignment period will normally be from August 16 through May 15 of the following 
calendar year, including the first faculty meeting of the academic year through final 
examinations and commencement ceremonies. The two-week period preceding classes will be an 
orientation/planning time. Summer is considered an “off-term” period. 
For AY appointments, the salary is paid in 12 installments on the last working day of 
each month. AY appointments include periods of paid holidays, and annual leave during the 
summer term. 
Full-time faculty are eligible to work during an "off-term" period and earn extra 
compensation. For example, a faculty member who is appointed for the fall and spring semesters 
will be eligible to work during the summer session and earn extra compensation in addition to 
their base salary. The faculty member's salary rate during the “off-term” period may not exceed 
one-third of the normal academic year salary. The compensations of full-time faculty members 
during the "off-term" period are calculated according to a policy defined by the Vice Rector of 
Academic Affairs. 

Faculty Load 
 
a. The standard teaching load at ADA University for assistant professors is six (6) courses, 
for associate and full professors is five (5) courses, each with no less than 6 ECTS, for the 
academic year.

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 49 ===
b. The standard teaching load at ADA University for instructors, senior instructors and lead 
instructors is eight (8) courses, each with no less than 6 ECTS, for the academic year. 
c. The standard teaching load at ADA University for EAPP instructors is 525- 540 hours. 
Depending on the contract type, it may also be offered as 450 as a standard load and 75 
hours as an overload. 
While determining the faculty load, the Dean should take into account responsibilities 
including curriculum development, academic advising, supervision of theses, supervision of student 
internships, service in professional organizations, and special community or university services. 
Other factors that need to be taken into account in assigning teaching loads are: class enrollment, 
number of preparations, preparations for new courses, amount and number of paper grading, team 
teaching, tutorial, independent study, or thesis courses, hours of graduate-level courses taught, and 
the number of registered thesis supervised. 
A faculty member's responsibility toward the University includes scholarship and service in 
addition to teaching. If the school and the faculty member request a teaching load beyond the 
established limit, approval of such a request must be forwarded to the Vice Rector of Academic 
Affairs on the recommendation of the Dean. 
 
Payroll Procedures 
 
Wages and Salaries 
Base Compensation is paid over a 12-month period, with deposits made at the end of 
each month and payable to the employee’s designated bank account. Base compensation is paid 
from the University funds. All payments are subject to the State Tax Regulations of the Republic 
of Azerbaijan, whereby, taxes are withheld at the source of payment. 
Base compensation rate may be adjusted in response to a core-line faculty member’s 
review by the University and core faculty member’s evaluation by the School. Said review and 
evaluation schedule is as follows: 
 
o For Core-line faculty in: 
• 
Initial Appointment – at the end of the first 3 years 
• 
Reappointment – at the end of the first 5 years 
o For Core faculty – biannually, every 2 years thereafter 
 
The adjustment is at the total discretion of the University. 
 
Taxes

Overload Pay 
 
This Policy applies to full-time core and core-line faculty. Faculty may request approval 
for overload pay related to teaching. Overload pay assignments require prior written approval (a) 
by the Dean of the faculty who will undertake the proposed overload pay assignment; (b) 
by the faculty affairs director in the Office of VRAA. To be approved, an overload pay 
assignment must meet the following minimum criteria: 
 
• The faculty requesting overload pay must have a full-time assignment in his/her 
school and be satisfactorily performing his/her assigned duties; and 
• The faculty's Dean, after consultation with the office of VRAA, must determine that: 
• proposed assignment represents a substantial increase over the faculty member’s 
regularly assigned duties; and 
• after considering the other commitments of the faculty, including his/her regularly 
assigned duties, and other professional obligations, the proposed assignment will 
not adversely affect the faculty's performance of his/her regularly assigned duties. 
• The approval of each overload pay assignment must be recorded on the Overload Offer 
Letter. 
Upon approval of the Dean and Faculty Affairs Director, a full-time faculty may elect to 
teach additional 2 courses during the academic year, beyond his/her full academic course load. 
Such faculty receive a flat rate gross compensation for teaching one section of the first course 
calculated at 40 percent of the Annual Tuition Rate for the instructional program in which they 
are teaching. If teaching one more section of the same course they receive 75 percent of the 
stipend of the first course, and 100% of the stipend if teaching different course. The gross 
compensation is paid in equal installments over 4 months or in one instalment at the end of the 
term. 
For teaching an overload during an academic year, EAPP instructors receive a flat rate 
net compensation calculated at 30 AZN/per teaching hour. 
All classes must meet the minimum class size of 15 students per section. Normal class 
size optimization must be evaluated as 40 students per course/section. 
 
Independent Study 
 
An independent study project may be compensated at five (5) percent of the overload 
stipend per project - not to exceed five projects per faculty per academic year - for work beyond 
a full academic course load at the discretion of the Dean. 
 
Other Provisions 

The Office of the VRAA shall provide an annual summary of overload pay 
disbursements made during the prior fiscal year to appropriate ADA faculty. In recognition of 
collegial expectations usual in a community of scholars, University units may not pay honoraria 
to faculty members, academic staff, executive managers, or academic administrators for talks,

seminars, etc., provided in usual classroom/seminar settings. 
 
Adjunct Pay 
Adjunct faculty are hired to support the staffing needs of schools during exceptional 
circumstances. Adjuncts are not intended to support ongoing instructional requirements. 
Adjunct faculty are not permitted to teach more than two courses (sections) per 
semester. All classes must meet the minimum class size of fifteen (15) students per section. 
Normal class size optimization must be evaluated as 40 students per course/section. 
Adjunct faculty receives a flat rate gross stipend for a semester. This rate is based on the 
following formula: 
• First Course (one section): the flat rate gross stipend equals 30 percent of the 
Annual Tuition Rate for the instructional program in which they are teaching. 
• Second Course: 
• Adjunct faculty receive 75 percent of the stipend of the first course if 
teaching one more section of the same course. 
• Adjunct faculty receive 100 percent of the stipend of the first course, if 
teaching a different course. 
The flat rate gross stipend is paid in equal installments over 4 months. 
 
Summer Session Pay 
 
Faculty members appointed on an academic year basis may be assigned teaching duties 
for the summer term in addition to fall and spring terms. A full-time faculty (core and core-line) 
may elect to teach additional 2 courses during the summer semester. 
 
• Such faculty receive a flat rate gross compensation for teaching the first 
course calculated at 40 percent of the Annual Tuition Rate for the instructional 
program in which they are teaching. 
• For the second section of the same course, they receive 75 percent of the 
stipend of the first course. 
• Faculty receive 100 percent of the stipend of the first course if teaching 
different course 
This flat rate summer compensation is paid in equal installments over 2 months. All 
classes must meet a minimum class size of 15 students per section. Normal class size 
optimization must be evaluated as 40 students per course/section. 
 
Faculty Records 
Official transcripts of all academic work completed by each full-time faculty member and 
a current copy of his or her vita and diploma are kept on file in the office of the Faculty Affairs 
and/or the Department of Organization and Personnel.

Part-time instructors who are faculty of record are required to ensure that their Deans 
receive copies of their academic transcripts and diplomas. Deans are responsible for verifying 
and certifying the authenticity of academic transcripts and diplomas (in electronic or paper form) 
once they are received. 
These records are then kept on file in the office of the Faculty Affairs or in the 
Department of Organization and Personnel or at a secure website. Faculty members should make 
sure their credentials on file are current. Faculty records should be retained for five years after 
resignation, separation, or termination. Employment and payroll records are maintained in the

Contracting and Probation Conditions 
All faculty and staff who are foreign nationals are required to secure valid immigration 
status and work authorization before their expected start date and maintain valid immigration 
status and work authorization throughout the employment.

intended date of resignation. Faculty submitting the resignation request in less than 120 calendar 
days will forfeit the last month’s compensation, benefits, bonuses, and similar financial earnings. 
The request shall then be tendered to the VRAA, who will notify the faculty member whether the 
resignation is accepted and any related conditions, including effective date of resignation. 
Resignation during an academic year must include due consideration as to how the 
faculty member’s departure will occur without disrupting instruction. Only in the most unusual 
and compelling circumstances will a resignation at other than the end of a semester be 
permitted and only when provision for qualified substitute instructors have been arranged in all 
courses. 
Faculty members leaving the University should contact the Department of Organization 
and Personnel for information concerning termination, continuation, or conversion of their 
benefit programs. 

Participation in Partisan Political Activities 
 
As citizens, the faculty/academic staff members of ADA University have the same rights 
and responsibilities of free speech, thought, and action as all citizens of Azerbaijan. Their 
position, however, imposes special obligations, such as emphasizing that they are not 
institutional spokespersons, and exercising appropriate restraint. 
 
Obviously, faculty/academic staff members have a binding obligation to discharge 
instructional and other regular duties, since performance of these duties may be impaired by any 
private activity requiring a large portion of time. For the mutual protection of faculty/academic 
staff members and the University, faculty/academic staff members campaigning as political 
advocates and/or candidates shall do so on their own time. For the period of such advocacy 
and/or candidacy, it is required that they obtain leaves of absence from the University.

Faculty Recognition Award 
“Best Müəllim” Faculty Recognition Award is for the purpose of rewarding exceptional 
performance in teaching, recognizing specific accomplishments of the faculty member. It is 
designed to complement the annual faculty performance evaluation and provide a financial reward 
to a select few who have outperformed and exceeded expectations during the academic year. 
“Outstanding Müəllim and Alim” Award will annually honor 1 faculty member of ADA 
University who demonstrates distinguished achievements in teaching and scholarship. 
The annual faculty performance evaluation will serve as the primary method for assessing and 
rewarding faculty members. Deans/Program Directors are responsible for evaluating faculty 
members’ performance and for nominating teachers for a recognition award. Faculty with a 
“Teaching Effectiveness” block rating of 125 and higher for the evaluated period are eligible to be 
nominated for “Best Müəllim” award. 
For further details of the Recognition Award policy and procedures see Appendix 7. 

Outside Employment and Work for Pay 
Full time faculty members are compensated for full time professional effort for the 
University. Faculty may have duties in instruction, scholarship, or outreach, or in a combination 
of these areas. Regardless of the character of the faculty member's duties, the University expects 
that each full-time faculty member will carry a reasonable and full-time load, assuming a proper 
share of the total functions and responsibilities of the school and University. Within this 
framework, the University recognizes that, through consulting and other relationships with 
government, industry, not-for-profit organizations, and others outside the University, its faculty 
members can make valuable contributions off campus while enhancing their expertise in their 
discipline. 
This Policy is intended to protect the integrity of the faculty-University professional 
relationship, to ensure that approved outside work for pay is consistent with the University's 
mission, and to provide that faculty members remain accessible to students, colleagues, and the 
public. This Policy applies to all faculty members (core and core-line) at the rank of instructor 
through professor. 
Certain activities are expected of faculty members as part of their normal scholarly 
activities and are not regulated by this Policy (even if a faculty member is paid to do them by a 
person or entity other than the University). These include, but are not limited to: 
 
• presentations at professional meetings and other similar gatherings; 
• peer review of articles and grant proposals; 
• leadership positions in professional societies; 
• preparation of scholarly publications;

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook

• editorial services for educational or professional organizations; 
• service on advisory committees or evaluation panels for government funding 
agencies, nonprofit foundations, or educational organizations; 

Limitations on Performing Outside Work for Pay During Assignment Period

will not exceed a total average of four (4) days a month. 
 
• The work in question will enhance the faculty member's expertise as a teacher and scholar 
in his/her discipline. 
• The work will not interfere with the performance of the faculty member's University 
duties, including those non-classroom responsibilities expected of all faculty members. 
• The work will not adversely affect the University's interests or violate University policies 
or regulations. 
• The work will be of a professional nature. 
 
Definitions 
• "Outside work" is any work performed for a person or entity other than ADA University.

• "Pay" is anything of value received in consideration for work, except reimbursement of 
expenses. Examples of pay include, but are not limited to, any salary, fee, honorarium, 
monetary gift or contribution beyond actual expense, or the promise of any of these in 
the future. Work for any business or other for-profit enterprise owned or operated by a 
faculty member or by his/her relative(s), shall be considered "pay" (whether the faculty 
member receives anything of value in consideration for the work) because of the 
likelihood that the faculty member's work will increase the value of the business or 
enterprise to the faculty member's direct or indirect financial benefit. 
Required Approval 
• A faculty member must request and obtain the written approval of his/her Dean before 
engaging in outside work for pay. 
• University administrators to whom the Authorization Form is submitted may seek 
additional information or clarification from the faculty member regarding the proposed 
outside work for pay. 
• University administrators shall process completed Authorization Forms in a timely 
fashion.

UNIVERSITY POLICIES 
 
University Policy on the Evaluation of Teaching Effectiveness 
 
General Guidelines 
 
• The University is committed to the goal of excellence in teaching. It therefore provides 
encouragement and means for faculty development and establishes ways to recognize and 
reward effective teaching. Evaluation of teaching serves to provide information to the 
faculty member for self-improvement. 
• In the evaluation of the various aspects of teaching performance, an emphasis should be 
placed on both skills and knowledge acquired by students in each course. Attention 
should also be paid to the relationship of the skills and knowledge acquired to the top 10 
competencies and learning outcomes defined by the University and the specific 
requirements of a given program. 
• Maximum effort must be made to develop cognitive skills through learning by doing.

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 66 ===
Faculty must ensure that a significant portion of teaching is based on practicum by using 
emerging tools such as flipped classrooms, mandatory graded teamwork projects, hybrid 
education, digital simulations, start-up demos, case method etc. so that our students 
learn how to apply their knowledge to solve real world problems. 
• A combination of methods must be used, so that each source of data will act as a 
check on the others and thereby contribute to a fairer evaluation. The interpretation of the 
data must be supplemented by cautious consideration of other factors germane to 
instruction, such as student ability and needs. Other factors to consider include grade 
distributions, class size, opinion survey response rates, and instructional format. Student 
learning is the result of the student’s skills and efforts as well as those of the instructor. 
• Great caution must be exercised to ensure that student opinion surveys are not used as a 
means to make fine distinctions among faculty members. The rating of an instructor in 
the majority category should be considered as evidence of teaching competence. Rank 
ordering of teachers or comparisons to program, school or University averages is not 
valid in the evaluation process. References to isolated student comments should be 
avoided unless an established trend can be demonstrated. When teaching is considered 
deficient or needs improvement, the evaluator(s) should make suggestions for 
improvement. 
• Variables, such as course level, type of course, class size, whether the course is core vs. 
elective, teaching load, etc., must be constantly investigated and taken into consideration 
by those involved in the evaluation process. Class attrition is a questionable measure of 
teaching effectiveness, but if it is to be used, its relationship to various variables must be 
examined. 
• Evaluators in all levels of the evaluation process must be attentive to allegations of bias 
and be particularly alert to patterns of possible discrimination. 
• Deans and appropriate faculty committees should be knowledgeable concerning the 
evaluation, interpretation, and use of the data gathered from the various evaluation 
sources. The University, through the Office of Academic Affairs and other means, should 
make available opportunities for faculty members and responsible administrators to 
obtain appropriate knowledge. 
• The data gathered in the evaluation process will not be made available to anyone beyond 
those officially part of the evaluation process without the written authorization of the 
faculty member. This restriction is not intended to apply to the University-wide 
statistical studies that do not reveal the identity of individual faculty members. 
• Appropriate school and University individuals and committees should regularly review 
these policies on the evaluation of teaching (including thesis and internship advisement) 
and how they are being implemented, both to ensure that they are not being violated to 
the possible detriment of the individuals being evaluated, and to initiate needed 
improvements. 
 
Portfolio Evaluation 
 
Evaluation of portfolios should be conducted every two years for core faculty, every year for 
core-line faculty.

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 67 ===
1. Teaching effectiveness is evaluated by an examination of all documents used in 
instruction. These documents are to be assembled by each faculty member and presented 
to the Dean in accordance with the established University annual evaluation schedule. All 
courses taught during the evaluation period should be included in the portfolio. 
2. Position Responsibility Statement, Classroom Visitation Report and Student Opinion 
Surveys are considered part of portfolio and included in Dean’s annual evaluation. 
3. This portfolio will consist of all instructor-provided materials used in each course (not 
section) during the period covered by the evaluation. Materials from only the most 
recently taught section of each course and only from courses taught during the period 
covered by the evaluation should be included. If the faculty member chooses, summer 
session courses may be included. Where it is impractical to include items, such as films, a 
description of those materials should be included. 
4. Examples of materials to be submitted are the course syllabus, assignment lists, research 
paper assignments, reading lists, study guides, handouts, problem sets, laboratory 
exercises, performance assignments, simulations, all testing materials including the final 
examination, efforts to improve teaching (including thesis advising), teaching 
development activities, and any other material or information that would assist the Dean 
in evaluating the effectiveness of teaching. 
5. In addition to course materials, the faculty member should also provide a summary of 
teaching and research/internship advising loads, grade distributions, the course objectives 
and methods used to evaluate student performance. 
6. The faculty member should also submit a narrative statement in which s/he critically and 
creatively reflects on the entire teaching process starting from course design, delivery and 
assessment suggesting innovative ideas in regard to teaching, knowledge integration, 
application and/or discovery. 
 
Provisions for Dean’s Evaluation 
 
The issues that the Dean will address in his/her evaluation are as follows: 
 
• Load of Faculty. The overall nature of the faculty member’s teaching tasks. Examples 
include number of courses taught, number of students in each course, whether the faculty 
member had graduate student assistance with large classes, presence of written work for 
large classes, number of thesis/internship students advised, and participation in distance 
learning and other teaching venues requiring extra time and effort. 
• Course Goals. Course goals and their preciseness, relevance, and measurability. The 
alignment of the course goals with the mission, core competencies and top 10 learning 
outcomes defined by the University. 
• Pedagogical Practices. The variety and impact of pedagogical practices employed by 
faculty to develop cognitive skills through learning by doing. Relevance of various 
instructional strategies to the defined course goals, competencies and learning outcomes. 
Extensive and consistent use of pedagogical tools available within Blackboard. 
• Teaching Resources. The overall quality of the materials selected for use by the faculty

member in each course covered by the evaluation. Issues include whether the materials 
are current and represent the best work in the field, whether the materials represent a 
superficial or a thorough coverage, how well the course has been developed, and whether 
the intellectual tasks set by the instructor are appropriate. 
• Assessment by Faculty. The overall quality of feedback, evaluation and testing in each 
course covered by the evaluation. Issues include whether the testing and evaluation 
procedures are consistent with the intellectual tasks set by the instructor and whether 
adequate feedback is provided to students in order to develop the desired levels of 
intellectual performance. If appropriate, the reasonableness of grade distributions will be 
addressed. Specific suggestions for improvement in any of the above areas will be 
included. 
• Professional Development Plan. The evaluation of portfolio process could result in 
faculty development plan for those faculty whose instruction, course materials, or 
assessment methods need improvement. Based on the evaluation outcomes, a core-line 
faculty may be offered several professional development opportunities: 
 
• Comprehensive Certificate Program on Teaching and Learning Effectiveness 
• Series of workshops on specific components of Teaching and Learning 
Effectiveness 
• Consultations on specific aspects of Teaching and Learning Effectiveness 
Proposals for faculty development funds should be submitted to the VRAA by the Dean. 
Classroom visitation 
A carefully designed and consistent classroom visitation program and schedule should be 
established within each academic unit. Classroom visitation must ensure consistent and sufficient 
controls to avoid prejudice or caprice. 
As part of Teaching Effectiveness Evaluation System (TEES) process, core-line faculty 
in Initial Appointment track are typically observed and evaluated four times during academic 
year: 
 
• one time by a peer evaluator internal to the school 
• one time by a peer evaluator from the other school 
• one time by a school administrator 
• one time by the University administrator 
The peer evaluators are experienced teachers chosen partly based on their own TEES 
performance. They serve as full-time evaluators as part of their institutional service. Preferably, 
both peer evaluators and administrators must complete a training workshop. 
The system requires that all new teachers participate in TEES during the first three years 
of service with ADA University. The three-year results of TEES are compiled in portfolios to be 
submitted for the initial review process.

ADA University

=== PAGE 69 ===
Core-line faculty in Reappointment track are observed and evaluated twice a year: once 
each semester, by a peer evaluator and school or University administrator. 
Core-faculty are typically observed and evaluated once a year by their peer and/or school 
or University administrator. 

Student Opinion Survey 
The schools are responsible for obtaining data to assist in the evaluation of teaching 
effectiveness within the school by means of a university-wide student opinion survey. 
Supplemental questions (or separate surveys) may be used by individual faculty. When courses 
are team-taught by more than one faculty member, students should be asked to complete separate 
surveys for each faculty member. Responses in the student’s own words are to be solicited on 
surveys. 
Students are to be made aware of the purposes and value of the survey. The standardized 
student opinion surveys will be administered online by the University. Students will receive 
multiple notices from the University and should be encouraged by the course instructors to 
respond. 
The statistical results, produced to ensure student anonymity, are made available to the 
faculty and to the Dean as soon as the results are produced or at the end of the normal grading 
period for the course, whichever comes later. Results for student opinion surveys where 10 or 
fewer students are enrolled in a class will be made available to faculty and administrators with 
the removal of demographic information. 
Individuals who have a role in the process of evaluating teaching effectiveness will have 
access to the statistical results as contained in the individual faculty member’s file. Survey results 
obtained by means other than these standardized procedures shall not be accepted as primary 
evidence of teaching ability. 
Student opinion surveys will be administered within the last two weeks of classes for the 
fall and spring semesters or sessions within them and during the last week of classes of the 
summer session for all faculty members, including adjunct faculty. 
 
Other Methods of Evaluation 
 
As noted above, schools desiring an additional method of evaluation should submit a 
proposal to the Dean for review and possible approval. Methods of evaluation that might be used 
are as follows: 
 
a. Student achievement tests should be used for evaluation of teaching if standardized 
and uniform questions and scoring are feasible, and there exists a wide testing sample 
of students with different instructors in different semesters or in different sections of 
the course. Testing shall be performed both early and late in the course to ensure a 
valid measure of learning achieved during the course. It should be developed and

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University

 June 2022

=== PAGE 70 ===
utilized, where possible, on a regular basis by the faculty on the school level. 
b. Student interviews - Systematic exit interviews or surveys, or interviews at 
predetermined stages of a student’s major program, may be conducted within each 
school. A standard format should be used. A means should be devised to ensure 
accurate recording of the interview, through the presence of a disinterested observer, 
through maintenance of a written account, or transcription of the interview, or 
through other appropriate means. Comments about individual faculty members should 
be transcribed and made available to them, although the identity of the students will 
remain confidential. 
Certain other procedures are generally considered to provide a less reliable contribution 
to a fair and systematic evaluation of teaching performance and therefore should be employed 
only with due caution. They include: (1) evaluation by organized student groups; (2) alumni 
surveys; and (3) self-evaluations. Normally, use of data based on these procedures should be 
limited to a supplemental role and not constitute a primary means of evaluating teaching 
performance. Schools that wish to use these or other techniques not noted above as a primary data 
source for the evaluation of teaching must develop clear standards of application for their use. 
These procedures and standards of application must be approved by the Dean and Vice Rector of 
Academic Affairs. 
It is the responsibility of schools to establish formal procedures for the evaluation of 
faculty, supervision of student research projects and internships. 

University Policy on the Evaluation of Scholarly and Creative Activity 
Our vision is to be a world class Azerbaijani university with an excellence of “Müəllim 
and Alim” in an innovative learning culture. At ADA University, we uphold the importance of 
these two qualifications. 
It is, therefore, expected of a faculty member to continuously engage in scholarly activity. 
Scholarship here is defined as the scholarship of discovery, application, integration, and 
teaching. This policy defines each type of scholarship, as well as criteria for promotion at ADA 
University. 
Scholarship of discovery is understood as original research that expands or challenges 
knowledge in scholar’s discipline. As mentioned by Boyer (1990)1, discovery is the creation of 
new knowledge and its purpose to contribute not only to knowledge but to climate of academic 
institutions as well. 
 
Classical examples of scholarship of discovery are: 
• publication of scholarly article in peer-reviewed journal of his or her discipline; 
• working papers;

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 71 ===
• books or book chapters in reputable publishing houses; 
• presentation of research findings at professional conferences. 
 
Scholarship of integration is closely related to the interdisciplinary debates making 
connections across disciplines and creating more coherent and integrated knowledge. 
Scholarship of integration would report findings of research designed to solve a practical 
problem; a new research problem identified through the application of the knowledge and skill of 
one’s academic discipline to a practical problem; findings that describe new knowledge obtained 
through the application of the knowledge etc. 
 
Classical examples of scholarship of integration are: 
• publication of scholarly article in peer-reviewed journal of his or her discipline; 
• professional development workshops; 
• literature reviews; 
• non-academic publications that address discipline-related concerns. 
 
Scholarship of application tries to build bridges with other disciplines, decision and policy 
makers and community to apply theory to solve every-day problem. Application 
scholarship links research with practice and involves engagement to translate new knowledge in 
practical interventions and solving problems experienced by society. 
 
Examples of scholarship of application includes but not limited to: 
• consulting activities in field of industry related to intellectual work of the faculty 
member; 
• support or development of community activities in the field or industry that link with 
academic discipline 
• publication of policy papers/studies/memos related to problem solution 
• formal development and oversight of partnership on behalf of the University that 
connect students with the field/industry (capstone; internship); 
• Media contribution (newspaper, magazine, etc) 
• development of Centers for Study or Service 
 
The scholarship of teaching extends beyond simply transmitting information to a process 
that is also transforming and extending the learning of students and scholars. The scholarship of 
teaching involves stimulating active learning, critical thinking, and the commitment to life-long 
learning. Examples of this type of scholarship include: 
 
• development of new or substantially revised courses, curricula 
• innovative teaching materials/strategies 
• educational research projects resulting in findings disseminated at professional 
conferences or peer-reviewed publications 
• production of videos for instructions 
• publication of textbooks or teaching materials

General Guidelines for Evaluation 
Within the types of scholarship defined above, the evaluation of scholarly activity 
should be based on these criteria. In evaluation, emphasis should be placed on quality, not 
just quantity. 
The following, where appropriate, are included in the definition of scholarly activity at 
ADA University: publications, presentations at professional meetings, grants and contracts, 
computer software and educational media, instructional research, interdisciplinary research, 
creative and artistic productions, translational research including patents awarded, and applied 
projects in technical and professional fields. 
1. Publications - In evaluation, the Dean should take into consideration and comment upon 
the reputation and editorship of journals in which the faculty member has 
published, the extent of external peer review of articles, level of authorship for the faculty 
member, e.g. sole, first, or second author, and the level of publications, e.g. international, 
regional or national. As a rule, the faculty is expected to publish in a peer-reviewed 
impact-factored journal of his or her discipline. Published books are evaluated on the 
level and reputation of the publishing company, e.g. international, regional, national, or 
self-published, and the nature of the reviews received. Evaluation of the quality of the 
publication is essential. For major personnel decisions (e.g., core and promotion) external 
evaluation of publications is required. 
2. Presentations at professional meetings - the Dean will be expected to evaluate such 
presentations on a similar basis to publications in learned journals - that is, taking into 
consideration the extent of external peer review before acceptance of the paper and the 
prestige associated with having a paper accepted for presentation at that meeting. 
3. Grants and contracts - In evaluation of faculty members' funded research activity, the 
Dean should take into consideration the aggressiveness with which the faculty members 
have sought out research opportunities (considering the availability of opportunities in 
their fields), the effectiveness with which faculty members have met the requirements 
established by the funding agency, the effectiveness with which the faculty members 
have worked with colleagues and contributed to funding for graduate assistants, and the 
leadership that faculty members have provided on particular grants (as principal 
investigator, co-principal investigator, collaborator, consultant or other major 
participant). 
4. Computer software and educational media - Creative work resulting in the creation of 
significant computer software or digital educational materials for use external to the 
University will be evaluated by the Dean based on external evaluations and reviews. 
5. Instructional research - The Dean should give credit to effective instructional research by 
faculty members, with emphasis on well-designed and controlled research in teaching, 
particularly in their own or closely related disciplines, and the recognition that the 
instructional research has received through publication or adoption at other institutions. 
6. Interdisciplinary research – Credit should be given for interdisciplinary and cross- 
disciplinary research, including collaboration with others outside the immediate field of 
expertise of the faculty member, whether internal or external to the University. 
7. Translational research and patents awarded are important components of faculty

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 73 ===
research in certain business and technical fields. The Dean should give credit for patents 
awarded and translational research that results in important new industrial or business 
applications. 
8. Research activities may include applied projects that directly support the needs of 
industry, government and/or the community, and result in a comprehensive published 
technical report. Examples include publications in trade journals, economic impact 
studies and forecasts, white papers, reports to government agencies, etc. Further 
examples of other appropriate research and scholarly activities are development of new 
products, processes, or techniques and software development. 
9. Other – Editorship of prestigious journals may be considered scholarly activity in certain 
disciplines. Book reviews, instructional manuals, and articles in national popular 
magazines related to the faculty member’s expertise may be considered but are not 
substantial scholarly publications. 
 
Promotion Criteria 
 
Promotion guidelines on scholarship for ADA University should be based on reasonable 
criteria. The following criteria are applied at the University level and are minimum requirements 
for consideration. Schools may have additional criteria beyond the following one. Assistant 
professor expecting to apply for associate professor rank should expect to present the following 
records of scholarly activity: 
 
1. Candidate should provide records of scholarly activity from one or more category of 
scholarship (discovery, integration, application, and teaching). 
2. At least two of the records must be an article in peer-reviewed journal with impact factor 
0.5 or above (Social Science Citation Index). One of the articles must be solo article or 
article where candidate is a principal investigator. 
3. Records of presentations at professional meetings. 
4. Record of outreach or other activities in which there was significant use of candidate’s 
expertise (consulting, reviewer for refereed journals, journal editor, peer review of grants, 
speaking engagements, services to governmental agencies, professional and industrial 
associations, educational institutions, etc.). 
 
It is the responsibility of the Dean to evaluate the quality of the scholarly activity of the 
faculty member (a mere listing of publications or grants does not constitute evaluation). For these 
purposes, each school should also establish, with the approval of the Dean, Vice Rector of 
Academic Affairs and Vice Rector of Scholarship and Graduate studies, a clear statement of the 
criteria for evaluating scholarly activity and research in that school. The criteria should take into 
consideration both the mission of the University and the nature of the scholarly activity within 
the discipline or related disciplines and in appropriate interdisciplinary venues. The school 
criteria should be attached to the evaluation by the Dean that is submitted to the Vice Rector of 
Academic Affairs and Vice Rector of Scholarship and Graduate Studies.

University Policy on the Evaluation of Service 
 
The category of professional service is more difficult to define than teaching or research 
but deserves the same kind of rigorous evaluation and positive credit given to teaching and 
scholarly activities. The Dean has the responsibility to seek out methods of evaluating quality of 
professional service, not merely to list the activities. The task is sometimes complicated by the 
fact that much professional service takes place outside the school. Ideally, each faculty member 
should exercise their professional expertise in both University service and community 
engagement. Where individual faculty members may be expected by the Dean to play different 
roles, those specific roles should be defined and understood. In all cases, service should be 
judged based on quality and effectiveness, not just quantity. 
Mentoring of students is one of the most important areas of faculty service, and each 
academic unit should develop methods of evaluating, encouraging, and rewarding excellence in 
student mentoring. School and University service also includes mentoring and counseling of 
students and junior faculty, special service assignments, sponsorship of student activities, 
cooperation with the Office of Development in outreach to alumni and securing external funding 
for the University, service on school and University committees and task forces, cooperation 
with the Office of Admissions in recruitment of students to the University, and other service 
activities. 
Community engagement is defined as the application of a faculty member's professional 
skills to engage with the external community in a manner that both assists the community and is 
consistent with fulfillment of the University’s mission. Community engagement in religious, 
political, or social organizations (although meritorious in itself) is not relevant to the faculty 
member's professional area. Examples of community engagement activities to be evaluated 
include participation in the University outreach programs, teaching noncredit courses, 
workshops, projects, and colloquia in the faculty member’s expertise, speaking engagements, 
both reimbursed and unreimbursed consulting activities, and other ways the faculty member uses 
his or her professional knowledge for service. 
Service to the discipline is also a community engagement. It is exemplified by service to 
scholarly or professional societies, journal editorships, peer review activities for scholarly 
journals, scholarly books and texts, and external funding agencies, and other ways of 
contributing to the advancement of the discipline or appropriate interdisciplinary fields other 
than in areas relevant to teaching and research. 
Service to scholarly or professional societies may include holding of office, serving on 
boards, chairing symposia, and special sessions at conferences, editing proceedings, reading non-
research papers, being instrumental in bringing a professional group to campus and serving on 
the local arrangements committee, developing a teleconference, and any other ways in which the 
faculty member is active within the professional society. It is the responsibility of the Dean to 
evaluate the quality of the work done for the professional society by the faculty member and the 
stature of the professional society itself and its relevance to the mission of the University.

Reporting and Evaluation of Service in Merit and Promotion Cases 
ADA will consider the service record just as it considers the teaching and research 
records in merit and promotion cases. Evaluation of service goes beyond the simple statement of 
“served on committee X’, instead, a detailed summary of the work performed should be 
provided, including time spent. 
The role of the Dean is to evaluate the faculty member’s service record. Enumeration 
does not constitute evaluation. Deans may want to consider developing expected or typical 
service “paths” for faculty in their academic units, to serve as models for their faculty. Deans 
should evaluate the academic importance of service roles the faculty members have filled, the 
effectiveness of the faculty member’s work in those roles, and the appropriateness of the service 
record given the faculty member’s career stage; comparisons with the service records of the 
others may be helpful. 

Appointment and Evaluation of Deans and Academic Deans 
 
Dean 
 
The Dean of a school is the chief administrator for that school who has the major 
responsibility for the leadership of the school. Duties of each Dean are specified in detail in the 
position description. Deans are expected to have excellent credentials in teaching, scholarship and 
service when hired. 
 
Appointment 
 
The Vice Rector of Academic Affairs is responsible for all aspects of the search process 
and ensures that it is carried out as specified by the University policy. Candidates selected for 
interviews should have the credentials for core-line and core faculty at the initial appointment at 
ADA University. The curriculum vitae and other relevant documents for each candidate must be 
made available to the school and University community prior to the interview. 
 
Deans are appointed for a term of five (5) years. A regularly scheduled review involving 
faculty input will be conducted after the third year. Deans serve at the pleasure of the Vice Rector 
of Academic Affairs. 
 
Evaluation 
 
Deans are evaluated annually during the first 3 years of their service and biannually, 
thereafter, during the spring semester for improvement, potential and merit consideration by the 
Vice Rector of Academic Affairs. The evaluation process is as follows: 
 
• The Dean prepares and submits a report of school achievements and personal professional 
growth to the Vice Rector of Academic Affairs. 
• Criteria for the performance appraisal shall be both generic and specific. Specific criteria 
refer to the school, and generic criteria are common to all Deans.

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University

=== PAGE 76 ===
• The Vice Rector of Academic Affairs will inform the Dean of the results of the appraisal and 
of the Vice Rector of Academic Affairs’ response to the evaluation materials in writing, 
including constructive criticism. 
• The evaluation results and the Dean’s reply (if any) will be retained in confidence by the Vice 
Rector of Academic Affairs and will be made available to the Rector. 
 
Review 
Deans are reviewed at the end of their third-year service. The third-year review process is 
conducted by the Vice Rector of Academic Affairs who notifies the core and core- line faculty that 
the Dean is being considered for review. 
Input from all full-time faculty in the relevant school will be solicited by the Vice Rector of 
Academic Affairs through use of a survey form that also provides for a written comment. 
Confidentiality and anonymity will be maintained. 
The Vice Rector of Academic Affairs will consider results of the Dean’s annual 
evaluations, progress in attaining goals, and faculty input. The Vice Rector of Academic Affairs will 
share his/her recommendations with the Rector and receive his input before making a decision. 
The Dean and faculty in the school will receive a summary report and a decision of the 
Vice Rector of Academic Affairs to reappoint or to not reappoint. 
 
Associate and Assistant Academic Deans 
 
These positions are staff appointments by the Dean of the school, in consultation 
and with approval of VRAA. 
 
a. Associate Deans are usually selected from core faculty in the school. 
b. The dean shall provide associate and/or assistant Deans with a job description that will 
form the basis for annual evaluations by the Dean. 
c. For all appointments, the Dean shall be responsible for initiating the search, forming the 
search committee, providing a written job description, inviting interested internal faculty 
to apply, and following established University policies and procedures. 
d. All associate and assistant Deans are evaluated annually during the first 3 years of 
their service and biannually, thereafter, in the spring semester by the Dean for 
continuance and potential. Annual evaluations of teaching, scholarship, and service 
should include input from faculty unless the associate or assistant Dean is a full-time 
administrator. Collaborative goals are set for the subsequent year after the evaluation is 
completed. 
e. The criteria for evaluation must be specific to the job description. 
f. The associate or assistant Dean will submit a report of yearly achievements and 
progress toward previous year’s goals to the Dean. 
g. The Dean will use the report and other relevant data to provide an evaluation. The 
evaluation will be provided to the associate or assistant Dean through a performance

appraisal letter. 
h. A reappointment process shall be conducted by the Dean every two years and shall 
include the results of annual/biannual evaluations and a survey to provide for faculty 
input. The associate or assistant Dean, the faculty and the Vice Rector of Academic 
Affairs will be notified of the decision to reappoint or to not reappoint.

Conflict of Interests in Education Responsibilities 
An amorous or sexual relationship between a student and a faculty member, a teaching 
assistant or another University employee who has educational responsibility for that student may 
impair or undermine the ongoing trust needed for effective teaching, learning and professional 
development. Because of the faculty member, teaching assistant or other employee's authority or 
power over the student, inherently conflicting interests and perceptions of unfair advantage arise 
when a faculty member, teaching assistant or other employee assumes or maintains educational 
responsibility for a student with whom the faculty member, teaching assistant or other employee 
has engaged in amorous or sexual relations. 
It is, therefore, the policy of ADA University that each faculty member, teaching assistant 
and other University employee who has educational responsibilities for students shall not 
assume or maintain educational responsibility for a student with whom the faculty member, 
teaching assistant or other employee has engaged in amorous or sexual relations, even if such 
relations were consensual. Whether such amorous or sexual relationships predate the assumption 
of educational responsibility for the student, or arise out of the educational relationship, the 
faculty member, teaching assistant or other employee shall immediately disclose the amorous or 
sexual relationship to the relevant academic unit administrator, who shall promptly arrange other 
oversight for the student. 

Conflict of Interests in Employment 
Standards for hiring, promotion, reappointment, evaluation, working conditions, 
responsibilities, salary, and termination for all employees at ADA University are based on ability, 
qualifications for the position, and performance. Relationship (meaning connection between 
persons, hereinafter referred to as "relatives," by blood, marriage, adoption, or other personal 
relationship in which objectivity might be impaired) to another individual employed by the 
University shall not constitute a bar to hiring, promotion or reappointment; provided, however, that 
no employee shall be under the direct supervision or control of a "relative." Employment of 
"relatives" in the same unit or department or under the same supervisor is authorized only with the 
prior written approval of the Office of the VRAA or the Department of Organization and 
Personnel, as appropriate. In addition, "relatives" should not participate in roles which have the 
potential for influencing employment decisions, e.g., peer review. 
Decisions about individual cases should be made based on these principles. In cases 
where the application of a principle is disputed, the administrator/supervisor at the next level 
may be asked to assist in resolution. The Office of the Rector has final approval regarding 
application of the general principles to particular cases.

Policy on the Use of Drugs, Alcohol and Smoking-related Products 
 
Drug and Alcohol-Free Workplace 
 
ADA University requires that faculty be informed that the unlawful or unauthorized 
manufacture, distribution, possession, or use of a controlled substance and alcohol is prohibited 
in the workplace. Any employee who commits any prohibited act under this policy shall be 
subject to the full range of disciplinary actions, including immediate discharge, and/or may 
be required to participate satisfactorily in an appropriate rehabilitation program. As a condition 
of employment, each employee must abide by the terms of this prohibition and notify his or 
her supervisor of any criminal drug statute conviction based upon conduct occurring either on or 
off the workplace no later than five days after such conviction. 
 
Use of Tobacco and Smoking-related Products 
 
Faculty, staff, and students are discouraged from smoking tobacco on campus. Smoking 
is allowed only in designated areas. Smoking outside the designated areas is sanctioned. 
Violators will pay a penalty in the amount of 250 AZN per each occurrence. 

Guidelines and Policy on Dealing with Disruptive Students 
 
Appropriate conduct by students is an absolute requirement in the school and in 
classroom and the University must operate with a policy of zero tolerance for any disruptive 
behavior. The term 'disruptive behavior' means any behavior that substantially interferes with the 
conduct of a class. 
Disruptive behavior may include but is not limited to: 
• Persistent late arrivals or leaving early in a manner that disrupts the regular 
flow of the class. 
• Talking while the instructor is talking. 
• Speaking in class without first obtaining recognition and permission to speak. 
• Use of electronic equipment such as cell phones, computers, MP3 players, etc. in a 
manner that disrupts the class. 
• A student who becomes belligerent or verbally abusive when confronted as a 
result of his/her inappropriate behavior. 
These guidelines are designed to provide faculty members with their options when 
confronted with disruptive students as well as inform them of the mechanisms they may use to 
correct the problem. 
The most powerful deterrent to classroom disruption is for the faculty member to provide 
class expectations concerning appropriate conduct in the classroom. Each faculty member 
should publish in the course syllabus the course attendance policy, behavior policies, and other 
expectations for appropriate conduct in the classroom. A faculty member may consider 
disruptive behavior when assigning grades for the class if participation is part of the final grade.

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 82 ===
Students do not have the right to engage in behavior that is disruptive in the classroom. 
The instructor of record has the authority to maintain appropriate classroom behavior in all 
courses offered by ADA University. Faculty have the right to immediately confront any student 
causing disruptive behavior, and request cessation of the behavior. A follow-up conversation 
with the student(s) is recommended to reinforce the faculty member's expectations for 
appropriate conduct in the classroom. In situations in which students are cooperative with the 
faculty member's request to cease disruptive behavior, the faculty member need only report the 
incident to the Dean. 
Should any student choose not to respond to a request to cease disruptive behavior, the 
faculty member should ask the student to leave the classroom to prevent further disruption to the 
class. A disruptive student should be reported to the Office of Student Services and Alumni 
Affairs for disciplinary action. Students engaged in classroom disruption will normally be 
charged with: 
 
a. Failure to comply with the directions of university officials, their authorized agents, and 
campus security officers acting in the performance of their duties; and/or 
b. Obstruction or disruption of university activities. 
Should a student refuse to leave a classroom when asked to do so or should a faculty 
member become concerned about his/her personal safety or the safety of the class, the ADA 
University Security Office should be called immediately to remove the student. Even if the 
student leaves the classroom before ADA University security arrive, the student is to be reported 
to the ADA University Security Office and the Office of Student Services and Alumni Affairs for 
appropriate disciplinary action. 
If a faculty member is concerned about the behavior of a student or a group of students, 
the Dean will consult with the faculty member about ways to improve the situation and will 
intervene to correct the problem.

APPENDIX 1. 
HONOR CODE 
Mission 
The ADA University is a community of students, staff, faculty and administrators united by 
the common goal of promoting excellence in education, research and service. ADA University 
strives to provide state-of-the-art facilities and excellent environment for its community members to 
engage in an inspiring and dynamic learning process. The University places a high value and 
emphasis on the academic success and achievements of its community members. 
However, this must be achieved only in an environment guided by academic honesty, 
integrity, and a commitment to personal and mutual accountability. 
The University’s philosophy is centered on the idea that academic integrity and honesty 
should be promoted not by the use of sanctions and threats, but rather, by instilling an academic 
culture that embraces these values in their own right. During the pre-curriculum phase, incoming 
students will devote a considerable length of time discussing generally accepted standards of 
academic integrity so as to avoid any possible misunderstandings or unintended violations of the 
codes of proper academic conduct. 
The Honor Code contains a list of academic rules and procedures essential to guiding the 
conduct of students, staff, faculty and administrators alike. The sanctions contained in this guide are 
intended only as a last resort, allowing ADA University to defend itself and its reputation against 
violations of these generally accepted standards of proper academic conduct. 
 
Principles of Academic Integrity and Honesty 
Do Not Lie! Purposefully providing false information and gaining an advantage or avoiding 
consequences by lying, falsification, deception, or fraud is not acceptable behavior at ADA 
University. 
Do Not Cheat! Violating the rules of the exams, tests, and other assignments as well as accepting 
unauthorized help is not acceptable behavior at ADA University. 
Do Not Plagiarize! Using someone else's intellectual work without giving proper credit to the 
author and submitting the same paper for two or more classes is not acceptable behavior at ADA 
University. 
Do Not Discriminate! Discrimination based on race, gender, ethnicity, religious affiliation, sexual 
orientation, or disabilities is not acceptable behavior at ADA University. 
Do Not Help Others Violate These Principles

Reporting Violations of the ADA Honor Code 
Students, staff and faculty who have become aware of possible violations of the ADA 
University Honor Code are expected to report these cases to the Dean of the appropriate school with 
the utmost urgency. This should be done orally or in writing, providing as many details as possible. 
Such reports to the Dean are normally adequate for reporting purposes. If taking reporting 
actions, any student, staff or faculty member should take appropriate account of the circumstances 
at the time. Any unnecessary disruption of classes or examinations underway should be avoided. 
The Dean will maintain the utmost confidentiality concerning such reports and will take 
precautions to ensure the anonymity of his/her source. The Dean shall submit the case to the Honor 
Committee for hearing, save in cases when the student admits the violation of the Honor Code. 
All written assignments at ADA University will be checked, if necessary, by an anti- 
plagiarism program. Should the report on the submitted assignment indicate a possible violation of 
the Honor Code, the relevant faculty member is required to provide the Dean with a copy of that 
report. 
The allegation of a faculty member’s violation shall be reported to the Dean who will 
subsequently report it to the Vice Rector of Academic Affairs. The Vice Rector of Academic Affairs 
shall form the Honor Committee. The Vice Rector shall take into account potential conflicts of 
interests when appointing Committee members.

University Honor Code.

current Undergraduate and/or Graduate Student Governments.

student members. The student members of the Committee shall be appointed by the Dean from the 
full list of members of Graduate and Undergraduate Student Governments to serve as a jury duty. 
The Dean shall take into account potential conflict of interests when appointing student Committee 
members. Dean reserves the right to select Graduate Government members for hearings 
of alleged violations by undergraduate students and vice versa select Undergraduate Government 
members for hearings of alleged violations by graduate students. Hearings of alleged violations by 
students are chaired by the Dean, whose task it is to ensure that proper procedures are adhered to. 
At no point shall the Dean express his/her views of the merits of the case. The Dean has a casting 
vote right in cases when the Committee is tied.

CORE COMPETENCIES AND LEARNING OUTCOMES 
Outcome Images of Our Students 
The ideal graduates of ADA will be educated through curriculum built around a triad of 
rigorous major study, functional enablers, and general education, provided with experiential 
learning opportunities through projects and trained to become high-impact graduates. The outcome 
images of these students are, therefore: 
1. Highly Intellectual Solution Providers 
2. Close Collaborators 
3. Effective Communicators 
4. Ethical Citizens 
Firstly, producing high impact graduates entails admitting the most qualified students that 
have potential to excel in academically rigorous curricula, developing these students into the 
country’s core manpower with critical thinking, analytical and problem solving skills, and 
ultimately delivering these students to the job market in all sectors of economy – industry, 
government, research or academic institutions – to effectively apply their knowledge and skills. 
Secondly, ADA aspires to produce ‘high impact’ graduates, rather than merely makers. High 
impact graduates are professionals, who are capable of applying their knowledge to solve problems 
and design processes requiring more sophisticated training and skills compared to makers whose 
main functions are carrying out specific tasks. For makers to become high impact professionals, it 
takes skills and knowledge build-up. The academic programs at ADA should adopt a project-based 
learning approach to prepare our students to become high impact graduates upon graduation. 
 
Core Competencies and Learning Outcomes 
ADA University has developed a set of Core Competencies which derive from and are 
consistent with our mission, outcome images and strategy. Competence is defined as a specific skill 
and body of knowledge, and the student’s ability to demonstrate that learning in assessment while at 
university and in workplace upon graduation. 
Each core competence, then, describes the desired Learning Outcome that students should 
be able to accomplish when they graduate, regardless of their program. Some institutions use 
learning objective and learning outcome interchangeably. We prefer to use learning outcome 
because of its direct focus on the result of the student learning. 
 
Outcome Image: Highly Intellectual Solution Providers 
Competence 1. Content Knowledge with Critical Thinking 
Learning outcome: The ability to develop a knowledge of content literature in a subject area;

FACULTY RECOGNITION AWARD 
Policy and Procedures 
“Best Müəllim” Faculty Recognition Award is for the purpose of rewarding exceptional 
performance in teaching, recognizing specific accomplishments of the faculty member. It is 
designed to complement the annual faculty performance evaluation and provide a financial reward 
to a select few who have outperformed and exceeded expectations during the academic year. 
“Outstanding Müəllim and Alim” Award will annually honor 1 faculty member of ADA 
University who demonstrates distinguished achievements in teaching and scholarship. 
The annual faculty performance evaluation will serve as the primary method for assessing 
and rewarding faculty members. Deans/Program Directors are responsible for evaluating faculty 
members’ performance and for nominating teachers for a recognition award. Faculty with a 
“Teaching Effectiveness” block rating of 125 and higher for the evaluated period are eligible to be 
nominated for “Best Müəllim” award. Several faculty members can be nominated, 3 candidates 
from each School (1 candidate from the School of Education) will be selected for “Best Müəllim” 
award. In exceptional cases, awards to more than 3 candidates may be considered. 
Only 1 nomination for “Outstanding Müəllim and Alim” Award will be accepted from each 
School. Candidates should present records of scholarly activity for the evaluated period - minimum 
one publication or acceptance about publication in a peer-reviewed journal with impact factor 0.5 or 
above (including multiple author papers). For SITE faculty only, presenting and publishing in 
proceedings of a reputable conference with acceptance rate of 10% or lower may be considered as 
minimum requirement as well. 
“Outstanding Müəllim and Alim” nominees will be considered by the Committee for “Best 
Müəllim” award as well. 
Deans/Program Directors should provide written justification regarding nominated faculty 
members’ performance during the evaluated period and explain how that performance translates 
into an award decision. 
All nominations will be reviewed by the Faculty Affairs Committee, Vice Rector of 
Academic Affairs and Rector, and a final decision on approved recognition awards will be 
presented in written form to each School. 
The value of “Best Müəllim” award is 1200 AZN, “Outstanding Müəllim and Alim” award 
– 2400 AZN. 
Awards will be presented every September at the ADA University Honor Code ceremony.

RESEARCH REWARD PROGRAM 
The Research Reward Program aims at honoring the efforts of ADA University researchers 
and encouraging them to contribute actively toward achieving internationally recognized research 
excellence and elevating ADA University’s academic rank. 
The reward program is valid for the period of one academic year2.The scheme for rewarding 
faculty publications is described below 
Eligibility 
1. Only ADA full-time faculty may apply for monetary remuneration. 
2. Monetary remuneration is applicable only to research outputs not sponsored by Faculty 
Research and Development Fund 
3. The authors should clearly indicate ADA University as their affiliation 
4. The following research outputs will be rewarded within the policy: 
• Research article in a journal indexed in SSCI or SCI/SCIE 
• Book published in A or B categories publishing houses (see Annex 1) 
5. Amounts of the rewards for publication and co-authoring are indicated below: 
Books 
• Book in Category A – 2500 AZN 
• Book in Category B – 1500 AZN 
Journal Articles 
Reward for each journal publication will be calculated based on the following formula: 
Reward = minimum of [(IF/IFm)1.5 x 1,000AZN] and [5,000AZN] where 
IF: impact factor of the journal 
IFm: median impact factor of the discipline 
Rationale of the formula: 
• Each reward is proportional to the impact factor of the journal. 
• Impact factors are adjusted based on the median impact factor of the discipline. 
• Publishing in high impact factor journals should get higher reward. 
• There is a cap on the maximum possible award. 
 
2 The Reward program will be applied for all publications starting from Fall 2020

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 114 ===
NOTE: Since the exponent (1.5) hurts the reward for publications that have adjusted impact 
factor lower than 1, exponent is removed for such cases.2 
Adjustments to journal publication reward based on co-authorship: 
• If two authors from ADA publish jointly, calculated reward is increased by 50% and 
shared equally among ADA University authors (i.e. if there are 2 authors from ADA 
University, each author receives amount equivalent to 75% of the calculated reward 
and if there are 3 authors from ADA University, each author receives amount 
equivalent to 50% of the calculated reward and so on.) 
• If there are more than 2 authors in the published paper, calculated reward will be 
discounted: for the publication with 3 authors by 10%, 4 authors by 20% and so on 
with 10% increments for each additional author.

COURSE LOAD 
Course Load for Faculty members holding Assistant and Associate Professor position 
• Regular teaching load of a faculty member holding the rank of Assistant Professor position 
is 6 courses per academic year. 
• Regular teaching load of a faculty member holding the rank of Associate Professor 
position is 5 courses per academic year. 
• The teaching load of an Assistant Professor, who shows no record of publication that meets 
minimum requirements (explained below) for the last three academic years, increases to 7 
courses in the next academic year. 
o 
If this faculty member, publishes a paper that meets minimum requirements during 
the next 2 academic years, his/her teaching load decreases to 6 courses per year. 
o 
If this faculty member does not show any record of publication for the next 2 
academic years, his/her teaching load increases to 8 courses in the next academic year, 
which can be reduced one at a time for each publication that meets minimum requirements. 
• The teaching load of an Associate Professor, who shows no record of publication that 
meets minimum requirements (explained below) for the last four academic years, increases 
to 6 courses in the next academic year. 
o 
If this faculty member, publishes a paper that meets minimum requirements during 
the next 4 academic years, his/her teaching load decreases to 5 courses per year. 
o 
If this faculty member does not show any record of publication for the next 4 
academic years, his/her teaching load increases to 7 courses in the next academic year, 
which can be reduced one at a time for each publication that meets minimum requirements. 
Definition of minimum requirements 
A publication by a faculty member should be in a peer reviewed journal with certain impact 
factor: the minimum impact factor requirement varies across disciplines. Based on the JCR 
statistics3, minimum requirements across the disciplines are set in the following way: 
• The formula used is as follows: pick the discipline A which has the lowest median 
impact factor of IFA and set the minimum requirement of 0.25 for that program. 
• For any other discipline B with median impact factor of IFB, we adjust the minimum 
requirement as follows: 
 
3 In order not to adjust the minimum requirements every year, this statistic can be calculated based on 5-year impact factor and used 
for the next 5 years.

JOINT LECTURE MODEL 
Definition 
Joint lecture is a model that can be used in situations where several sections of one course is 
being offered. The class meetings in this model are arranged as below for a typical 6-credit course, 
that usually meets twice a week during a regular Fall and Spring term. 
1. First class meeting is joint online lecture: here all CRNs of the course meet online 
2. Second class meeting is seminar: here each CRN meets separately either online or 
face-to-face. 
Note: Courses that require teaching of heavy practical skills can use JLM with additional 
(third) class meeting (seminar). Additional meeting times can be scheduled for other courses, 
too. 
Joint lecture model (JLM) can be used with below conditions: 
• Course must be offered in Year 1 or Year 2 according to the relevant Program of 
Study (PoS). 
• Course must be offered at undergraduate level. 
• Schools must include JLM course requests into Course Offerings for each term. 
JLM requests are collected by the Office of Admissions and Student Records and 
approved by the Office of Academic Affairs. 
Teaching load of faculty who is assigned a course using JLM will be calculated with below 
conditions: 
• Teaching load is considered to be 8 hours per week for one section (CRN), divided 
equally between teaching time and student load. One section/CRN with no class 
meeting time is considered as 0.5 load. One class meeting time without student load 
is considered as 0.25 load. 
• Load sections= CRN x 0.5 + class meeting times x 0.25 
• Additional meeting times will be included into teaching load calculation.

Online Exams Regulations 
This document is not intended to replace the current Exam Rules and Regulations. The 
intention is to provide the regulations for making online exams to run as close to the rules as 
possible. 
This document applies to all exams as defined below, no matter what their grade weight is. 
Failure to observe these regulations will be generally treated as a violation of the Honor Code. 
Definition 
Online exams can be classified into different groups by one or more criteria listed below: 
• On-campus or Outside-campus 
• Synchronous or Asynchronous 
• Proctored or Non-Proctored 
• Computer-based or Paper-based 
• Written or Oral

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 123 ===
Synchronous online exam: online exam that requires the students to be connected and sit the 
test within the defined relatively ‘short’ time period. The ‘short’ time period is defined to be about 2 
hours maximum. 
This document is regulating Outside-campus Synchronous Proctored online, Computer-
based, Paper-based and Oral exams. 
Regulations 
Online exams are creating challenges for ensuring the adherence to Exam Rules in 
Regulations as they are more prone to cheating. Thus, there is a great shift of responsibility to the 
side of students both from technical and behavioral perspective. The following additional 
regulations are applied: 
1. Students are responsible to ensure that the required technological capability e.g. 
computer, camera, Internet connection, etc. is in place. 
• The general premise is that if in on-site exams the physical ability to be in the 
exam is required for passing, in online exams certain technological capability is 
required. Academic Policies and Procedures regulate the cases of excused 
‘absence’. 
• Students are strongly recommended to have a backup option of more reliable 
Internet connection e.g. mobile hotspot. 
2. Students are expected to be familiar with the technology and procedures ahead of the 
time, so any technical problems are communicated to the professor of the course on a 
timely manner, to be resolved with IT Helpdesk. 
3. Students are responsible to ensure all required software is properly installed on the 
computer they use to sit an online exam. 
• The approved tools for online proctoring are Respondus® LockDown Browser 
together with Monitor that work with Blackboard® learning management system 
the university uses. While LockDown Browser prevents the student from using 
additional applications and functionality on their computers, Respondus Monitor 
uses their camera and microphone to record the environment and flag any 
potentially suspicious behavior. 
• Microsoft® Teams and Zoom videoconferencing software can be used, too. 
4. Students bear responsibility for ensuring that nobody else is using their credential to 
enter the software systems used for online exams. Failure to observe this requirement 
will be treated as a violation of the Honor Code. 
5. Students are responsible to ensure the environment e.g., lighting, camera angle, etc. is 
meeting the requirements of online proctoring. They should be ready to show 360-
degree view of the environment any time before, during and right after the exam. Their 
microphone should be open all the time. 
6. Students are expected to be ready for additional proctoring requirements, for example:

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 124 ===
submitting the screenshots of their computer desktop, arranging a second camera for 
additional monitoring and live feedback, etc. 
7. Computer-based online exams will run as Blackboard tests with the following options 
on: 
• Display After: The questions will be released/visible right after the start of the 
exam. 
• Randomize Questions: The questions will be selected randomly for each 
student. 
• One at a Time: The questions are not visible at once, shown one question at a 
time. 
• Not showing right or incorrect answers at the end of the test. 
• Additional options may include: Password-protection, Prohibit Backtracking 
that prevents changing the answer to a question that has already been submitted, 
etc. 
8. Paper-based online exams will start and finish in Blackboard as per the following 
scenario: 
• In case of handwritten paper-based online exam, students will prepare empty 
white papers for their notes and will make sure to put their name on each page.

APPENDIX 13. 
STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT 
ADA University as an educational institution has a set of standards, attributes, and purposes 
essential to its existence and well–functioning. We ensure access and opportunity for every ADA 
University student to obtain their educational objectives within a safe, healthy, inclusive, 
intellectually rich educational environment throughout their time at the University. The Student Code 
of Conduct capitalizes on ADA University’s commitment to promote intellectual development, 
sense of ethical citizenship, and personal responsibility of its students. 
Students of ADA University are expected to act in accordance with the following outcome 
images in consideration of best skills and knowledge vested in them: 
• Highly Intellectual Solution Providers 
• Close Collaborators

are directly affecting the ADA community, its students, officials of the University, breaches of the 
national law, and if student’s misconduct negatively affects pursuit of ADA’s mission and its 
image. The University will take any breach of the Code of Conduct seriously and exercise 
disciplinary measures when required. 
1. Expected behavior

APPENDIX 14. 
EVALUATION OF ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE 
Judgment regarding standards of evaluation for a student’s academic performance is a 
faculty responsibility. Students should consult the policy on Student Academic Grievances for any 
matters of concern. No single grading component of courses taught at ADA University shall exceed 
the 40% of the overall course grade. 
Class Attendance 
Individual instructors may have different attendance requirements; it is the student’s 
responsibility to check each course syllabus to determine policy and to speak to instructors 
regarding absences. Absences may adversely affect a student’s grade. Students are required to 
make-up all work missed because of absence by the end of the term. If the student cannot complete 
the work by the end of the term, he/she may receive an Incomplete grade only at the instructor’s 
discretion. 
Students who miss more than twenty-five percent (25%) of classes will be assigned FX as a 
grade. 
EAPP Class Attendance 
EAPP class attendance policy excuses from two to four student absences per 7.5-week session, and 
four to eight absences per a 15-week session. See the table below: 
 
Number of classes per level 
Number of excused absences 
7.5-week session 
32-36

=== PAGE 133 ===
50-54

=== PAGE 134 ===
15-week session 
45-60

=== PAGE 135 ===
Ten percent (10%) of the total course grade will depend upon physical attendance in class. 
For each additional absence, a student will lose 2.5 percent of his/her overall grade. In other words, 
four (4) absences extra to the excused absences will exhaust all 10 percent allocated for attendance. 
Tardiness: EAPP students are responsible for arriving in class on time. Albeit the instructor 
may allow said student into the class, late arrival by 5 minutes or more is considered as a complete 
absence. 
Final Exam Policy 
• Students are expected to take final exams at the times scheduled by the Office of

ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
ADA University 
Faculty Handbook 
 June 2022

=== PAGE 136 ===
Student Records and Registration. 
• Students with two exams scheduled for the same time, and students with three or more 
final exams on a given day should submit a request to reschedule an exam to the Dean’s 
office of their academic unit. 
• This request must be submitted via email no later than 3 days after the announcement of 
exam dates. 
• Provided an exam can be rescheduled, the exam from the class with the lowest enrolment 
will be rescheduled. 
• All rescheduled exams must occur during the final exam period. 
• Unexcused absences at final exams may result in a failure for the course or similar 
substantial penalty. 
• Students must follow any additional policies or procedures for final exams set by 
individual academic units. 
Students are entitled to receive their final grades 96 hours after the completion of the exam 
period. 
Repetition of Courses 
Repeating courses can have academic and financial implications for the student. 
• Graduate students must repeat courses with a grade of “C-” and below. 
• Undergraduate students must repeat major core courses with a grade below “C-”. 
• EAPP students must repeat a level with an overall grade below “C”. 
• Withdrawal from a course counts as an attempt, but it is excluded in the Repeat process. 
Students must contact their Academic Advisor as well as the Office of Student Accounts for 
additional information and assistance before deciding to repeat a course. 
EAPP students have two (2) attempts to pass the same level. EAPP students are not eligible 
for a withdrawal. 
Students are responsible for determining any academic or financial implications for 
repeating courses. In the context of this policy, passing a course includes meeting any stipulations 
needed to satisfy a University or major requirement. 
Grades for each attempt of the same course are recorded on transcript, but only the highest 
grade and the credit associated with that grade will count toward the major GPA requirements. W is 
excluded in the Repeat process. Courses that are not identical in course subject and course number 
will appear on the transcript and each grade will be calculated in the student’s GPA.

course did not satisfy the Instructor’s summative requirements for passing the course. 
Administrative Fail (FX): The instructor assigns Administrative Fail in lieu of a grade of F 
(Academic Fail) when a student never attended or ceased attending the class or violated Honor 
Code. 
Final numeric grades for courses are mathematically rounded before assignment of the 
relevant letter grade. For example, a total numeric of 93,45 will be rounded to 93 and will be 
assigned a letter grade of “A-”; a total numeric of 93,50 will be rounded to 94 and will be assigned a 
letter grade of “A”; a total numeric of 93,51 will be rounded to 94 and will be assigned a letter 
grade of “A”.

Incomplete Grades 
At their discretion and before the end of the semester, professors may give an Incomplete 
status for a grade when a student, who could otherwise pass a course, is prevented from completing 
it during the semester due to extenuating circumstances. 
The instructor must provide in writing to the student the conditions for satisfying the 
Incomplete and submit the Incomplete Grade form to the Office of Admissions and Student 
Records. Those conditions must include what work needs to be completed, when the work must be 
completed, and what the course grade will be if the student fails to complete that work. All 
incomplete coursework must be completed before the end of the following semester absent an 
agreement to the contrary. 
Instructors will submit the grade of “I” and the conditions for completion to the Office of 
Admissions and Student Records when submitting all other final grades for the course. 
The Office of Admissions and Student Records will assign the default grade of F 
automatically if students do not meet the conditions or if they are separated from the 
University. 
Students on academic probation may not receive an Incomplete. Multiple outstanding 
Incomplete grades may affect the student’s ability to maintain Good Academic Standing. 
Students may not retroactively withdraw from any course where an Incomplete grade has 
been recorded. 
An Incomplete may not stand as a permanent grade and must be resolved no later than the 
end of the next semester. In addition, students will not be allowed to graduate while an Incomplete 
grade remains unresolved. Graduation may be delayed to the next graduation date in this case. 
Grades for Thesis 
Thesis credits are graded as Pass or Fail. Grades associated with Thesis course (P or FZ) 
affect student’s cumulative credits but are not used in computing the GPA. 
At their discretion and before the end of the semester, professors may give an Incomplete 
status for a grade when a student, who could otherwise pass a course, is prevented from completing 
it during the semester due to extenuating circumstances. 
An Incomplete may not stand as a permanent grade and must be resolved no later than the 
end of the next semester. Students requesting extension for one more semester will have financial 
implications and must get the approval of academic unit In addition, students will not be allowed to 
graduate while an Incomplete grade remains unresolved. Graduation may be delayed to the next 
graduation date in this case. 
In case a student fails Thesis, he/she will not be able to graduate.
