1.4.6 CURRICULUM STRUCTURE 
AND REGULATIONS 

1. Purpose 
 
ADA University strives to ensure the coherence, breadth and high quality of its degree programs. This 
requires that all programs adhere to a set of curriculum regulations and to a corresponding curriculum 
structure. The curriculum structure may differ across different Schools and programs, but the design 
and delivery of all degree programs and curricula must follow certain minimum requirements. This 
ensures that all students enrolled in degree programs at ADA University are educated through similarly 
structured, comprehensive curricula and are able to achieve pre-defined learning outcomes. The 
purpose of this document is to outline ADA University’s curriculum structure and regulations. 

2. Scope and Recommendations 
 
This regulation applies to all undergraduate and graduate degree programs at ADA University. 
 
Schools are expected to follow the curriculum structure and regulations outlined in this document as 
well as ADA University’s Undergraduate Degree Regulations, Graduate Degree Regulations and 
Degree Program Development and Modification Policy when launching new degree programs and/or 
modifying current degree programs. 

3. Definitions 
 
General Education: This encompasses courses offered to all students enrolled in undergraduate degree 
programs at ADA University. The purpose of the General Education component is to cultivate a well-
rounded person in foundational areas such as the Humanities, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences and 
Quantitative Reasoning; Writing and Information Literacy; and Leadership and Communication. 
 
Major Core: Courses labeled as Major Core offer a fundamental understanding of subjects covered by 
a student’s main field of specialization. Major Core courses are a mandatory part of a degree program. 
 
Technical Electives: These are courses in advanced topics covered by a student’s main field of 
specialization. Students are offered a range of Technical Electives to choose from. 
 
Free Electives: Any credit-bearing course can be considered a Free Elective if the respective course is 
not an integral part of a student’s degree program. Free Electives can be chosen from any other degree 
program offered at ADA University. 
 
Functional Enablers: These are courses that aim to develop core study- and work-related skills. 
Functional Enablers cover IT skills, but also internships and career strategies.
