I. 
Mission 
The ADA University is a community of students, staff, faculty and administrators united by 
the common goal of promoting excellence in education, research and service. ADA 
University strives to provide state-of-the-art facilities and excellent environment for its 
community members to engage in an inspiring and dynamic learning process. The University 
places a high value and emphasis on the academic success and achievements of its 
community members. 
 
However, this must be achieved only in an environment guided by academic honesty, integrity, 
and a commitment to personal and mutual accountability. 
 
The University’s philosophy is centered on the idea that academic integrity and honesty should 
be promoted not by the use of sanctions and threats, but rather, by instilling an academic 
culture that embraces these values in their own right. During the pre-curriculum phase, 
incoming students will devote a considerable length of time discussing generally accepted 
standards of academic integrity so as to avoid any possible misunderstandings or unintended 
violations of the codes of proper academic conduct. 
 
The Honor Code contains a list of academic rules and procedures essential to guiding the 
conduct of students, staff, faculty and administrators alike. The sanctions contained in this 
guide are intended only as a last resort, allowing ADA University to defend itself and its 
reputation against violations of these generally accepted standards of proper academic 
conduct. 
II.

a. Do Not Lie! Purposefully providing false information and gaining an advantage or avoiding

unauthorized help is not acceptable behavior at ADA University.
