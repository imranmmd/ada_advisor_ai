4171. Tuition Refund Policy 
1.1. When students wish to withdraw from all of their courses, their fees will be adjusted 
according to the schedule in Annex 1. If the fees already paid exceed the adjusted 
payment due, an amount is considered as an overpayment, and will be transferred to 
the next active term. 
1.2. Students who voluntarily separated or have been involuntarily separated from 
university can request a refund of their overpaid amount within the term that their 
separation/dismissal was documented. If a student is under 18 years old, then the 
refund can be made to the student’s parents’ account. Requests made later than this 
period will be dismissed, while the amount will be considered forfeited and/or donated 
to ADA University. 
1.3. Students who have graduated may request a refund of their overpaid amount within 
the same financial year following their graduation date. Requests made later than this 
date will be dismissed, while the amount will be considered forfeited and/or donated 
to ADA University.
