2. Rallying Round ADA Flag 
The ADA Flag consists of three stripes. These stripes extend vertically. Each stripe is one-third of 
the total area of the flag. From inside out, they alternate in colors of Blue, White and Red. In the center of 
the flag and inside the white stripe, the letters ADA are centrally placed on top of four lines. The letters are 
in red, while the four lines are in blue. 
Blue means loyalty and communication. We are an intimate community upholding certain 
principles and values. Our loyalty to them has been rock solid. Our story is about citizenship, honor, 
integrity, truth, intellectual curiosity, diversity, change, respect, tolerance, perseverance, merits, 
collaboration and giving back. We live to create our own story in life. We communicate well this story and 
transmit our values among us and through years. 
White means purity of honor. Clean, spotless and transparent. We pledge to honor and live by 
honor. White also stands for the purity of mind, clean of prejudices, and in search of knowledge, 
enlightenment and education. 
Red symbolizes life, energy, vibrancy, rejuvenation, reinvention, and innovation. ADA is a thriving 
location. In this volcano of ideas and initiatives, we encourage minds to explode. We challenge static 
thoughts. We conquer the heights through continuous learning and restless innovation of selves. 
The four lines of blue represent Four Pillars of ADA: Global Citizenship, Innovative Learning, 
Social Responsibility and Thriving Location. Standing tall on top of these four pillars, ADA thrives and 
reinvents itself in perpetuity.

Yorulmaq sözünü tam unutmuşuq. 
Gör neçə ölkəyə körpü qurmuşuq?! 
Tükənməz gəncliyin əzmkarlığı, 
Yaşa ey ADA-nın nurlu varlığı. 
 
NƏQARƏT: 
Qoy eşitsin bəşər, qoy bilsin cahan, 
Məkan o məkandı, zaman o zaman. 
Dünyaya günəştək doğ, Azərbaycan!!! 
Yayıl ayın, günün şəfəqləriylə, 
ADA-nın işıqlı səhəri ilə. 
Həyata eşqimiz axar çay kimi, 
Əməyə sevgimiz bir bulaq kimi, 
Həmrəyik, güclüyük uca dağ kimi. 
Seçmişik hünəri, qəhrəmanlığı, 
Yaşa ey ADA-nın nurlu varlığı. 
ADA UNITED 
Englightenment has taken the leading role 
In our lives and minds, thus, we stand tall 
Building bridges we connect to the world. 
Perseverance is our story to be told 
With passion to learn at ADA! 
 
CHORUS: 
Let the universe hear when we say 
Azerbaijan’s voice is heard far away 
The time has come for us today 
To pursue our dreams in an honest way 
Through passion for learning at ADA! 
At the crossroads of East and West, 
United we stand, strong we emerge 
Breaking barriers on the way to the best,
